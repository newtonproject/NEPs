Review NEP-0 and guidelines in this document. Fork the repository by clicking \u0026ldquo;Fork\u0026rdquo; in the top right. Add your NEP to your fork of the repository. Use a template to start your NEP. Submit a Pull Request to Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs repository.  Start A NEP #  We welcome anyone with suggestions related to Newton Project to compile a NEP.\nBefore you begin writing a formal NEP, you should vet your idea. Ask the Newton community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research.\nIn addition to making sure your idea is original, it will be your role as the author to make your idea clear to reviewers and interested parties, as well as inviting editors, developers and community to give feedback. You should try and gauge whether the interest in your NEP is commensurate with both the work involved in implementing it and how many parties will have to conform to it. Negative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your NEP from moving past the Draft stage.\nFor more:\n  Contributing A NEP  NEP Submission Guides for Beginners  Your first PR should be a first draft of the NEP. It must meet the formatting criteria. An editor will manually review the first PR for a new NEP and assign it a number before merging it. Make sure you include a Discussions header with the URL to a discussion forum or open GitHub issue where people can discuss the NEP as a whole.\nOnce your first PR is merged, it will be merged to draft NEPs. For this to work, it has to be able to tell that you own the draft being edited. Make sure that the \u0026lsquo;authors\u0026rsquo; line of your NEP contains either your GitHub username or your email address inside . If you use your email address, that address must be the one publicly shown on your your GitHub profile.\nTo update a draft NEP, you need to created another PR after edit. Once the PR is merged, your updated draft NEP will be merged to draft NEPs.\nFinalize a draft NEP: When you believe your NEP is mature and ready to progress past the Draft phase to Final, you should do:\nOpen an issue to request for make the NEP Final. An editor will review your request and ask if anyone objects to its being finalised. If the editor decides there is no rough consensus - for instance, because contributors point out significant issues with the NEP - they may close the issue and request that you fix the issues in the draft before trying again.\nIf your request for finalised a NEP has been approved, an editor will change the NEP status to Public Call for anyone to check it can be a Final NEP. Once the Public Call period has passed. An editor will update the status to Final.\n"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/guides/nep-submission-guide-for-beginners/','title':"NEP Submission Guides for Beginners",'section':"NEPs Guidelines",'content':"This doc was originally from https://github.com/newtonproject/NEPs/wiki and should be added to a NEP as reference.  This guide is for those unfamiliar with the NEP Process and provides simple instructions for NEP submission, update, and request for final. This guide won\u0026rsquo;t cover complex NEP status change and other requests described in NEPs Guideline.\nThis guide covers:\n  Start A NEP\n  To Submit NEP for The First Time\n  To Update a Draft NEP\n  To Make A NEP to Final / Active\n  I. Start A NEP #  You can start writing your thoughts of a NEP first. And check if your thoughts are already in the existing NEPs.\nYou can choose from the NEP templates to get started. Since you already wrote down your thoughts, try to use a template from and finish the Summary and Abstract section. If your thoughts are not formed well enough, you can choose to skip the templates and use it later.\nDiscussion with other people, try to get one or more people become your co-authors, that helps your NEP become more carefully considered. Also it is recommended to have a public discussion board from the beginning. You can choose any public discussion services such as Google Groups, Facebook Pages, or your own Github repos.\nYou can choose any text editor apps to work with. If you are more familiar with Google Docs, Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, it is okay to use them to begin with. But the formal NEP for submission requires a Mark Down format. You will need to use a NEP template later.\nII. To Submit NEP for The First Time #  All NEP submissions require to make a Pull Request(PR) from your own git repository on Github. If you haven\u0026rsquo;t forked the NEPs repository, please follow the guide below to fork the NEPs repository and add your NEP to your repository.\nFork the NEPs Repository #    You need a Github account and to be logged in\n  Click the Fork button on the upper right of the NEPs Github Page\n  You have successfully forked the NEPs repository\n  Add your NEP to your repository #    Choose a template to start with.\n  Add your NEP to NEPS/NEP-X/index.md file\n  Create Pull Request for NEP submission #  Make sure your NEP documents and assets follow the NEPs guideline. All NEPs submission not following the guideline require may get rejected.\n  Change the NEP status from WIP to Draft when it\u0026rsquo;s ready for submission\n  Perform a PR from your repository to Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs repository.\n  State clear you are submitting the NEP for the first time in the title.\n  Make sure to check Allow edits from maintainers\n  NEP Editor Review #    NEP Editors will review your submission.\n  If your NEP requires modifications, NEP Editors will point out and ask you to make changes in your repository.\n  If the NEP editor thinks your NEP is ready for the Review Board to review. A NEP Editor will assign a NEP number and update your documents. You can not add/change your NEP number by yourself. If you self added/changed the NEP number. The submission will be rejected.\n  NEP Board Review #    The NEP Review Board host meetings for NEP review regularly.\n  The Authors may be invited to join the meeting depending on the type or contents of your NEP.\n  If your NEP passed the review. Your NEP submission will pass and NEP Editors will include(merge) your NEP to Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs Repository.\n  If your NEP is good but require small changes like description, content naming space, add references to support your NEP. You should update your NEP documents. Once you have completed the change, add a reply to your PR and mention a NEP Editor to review your change. Once reviewed and the NEP Editor thinks it meets all the questions/problems from the Review Board. The NEP Editor will pass your NEP without additional review from the NEP Review Board, the NEP Editor will include(merge) your NEP to Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs Repository.\n  If the NEP Review Board thinks the NEP will not pass. Your submission will be rejected. And the PR will be closed. If you wish to continue on the same NEP, you can make a new PR in the future.\n  As long as your new NEP PR is talking about the same thing and you kept NEP number assigned history from the NEP Editor in your repository. You can use the same NEP number in your future submission.\n  III.

You may work on that and submit new updates to that NEP.\nOnly NEP in Active/Draft status can accept updates*\nOnce a NEP become Final. It can no longer accept changes.\nAn Active status NEP can accept updates for adding features, but other parts can not be changes.\nCreate Pull Request for NEP update submission #    Perform a PR from your repository to Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs repository.\n  State clear you are updating a Draft NEP in the title. E.g. \u0026ldquo;Update NEP-3\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell what have been changed to the last Draft in the descriptions.\n  Make sure to check Allow edits from maintainers\n  Review Procedure #  The review is pretty much alike to Submit your NEP for the first time. Except there may be no NEP Review Board reviews required depending on the updates of the NEP.\nIV. To Make A NEP to Final / Active #  A NEP Draft must be already in Newton NEPs repository before requesting for it to be finalised.\nCreate an Issue for NEP to be finalised #    Create an issue in Newton\u0026rsquo;s NEPs repository on Github.\n  State you want to finalised a NEP in the title. E.g. \u0026ldquo;NEP-3, request for Final\u0026rdquo;\n  Tell why you think it can be finalised in description.\n  NEP Editor Review #    NEP Editors should check the request and go through the current Draft.\n  NEP Editors should also check if the request is agreed from all the authors.\n  NEP Editors should ask the NEP Review Board to include this topic in the next meeting.\n  NEP Review Board Review #    NEP Review Board should make the decision whether the NEP can/should be finalised.\n  NEP Review Board should also giving a Public Review period. Normally 14 days, but depending of the NEP, the period may change.\n  Public Review #    If the NEP Review Board decides a NEP can be finalised, a Public Review is going to happen.\n  NEP Editors should change the NEP status to Public Call.\n  The Public Call of a NEP should be prominently listed on Newton Project\u0026rsquo;s official website.\n  Any change request to the NEP document during the Public Review will result the NEP status revert to Draft.\n  When a NEP has passed the Public Review. NEP Editors will update the status to Final/Active.\n  "});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/guides/nep-process/','title':"NEP Process",'section':"NEPs Guidelines",'content':"This doc was originally from https://github.com/newtonproject/NEPs/wiki and should be added to a NEP as reference.

NEP Editors Responsibilities #  For each new NEP that comes in, an editor does the following:\n Read the NEP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don\u0026rsquo;t seem likely to get to final status. The title should accurately describe the content. Check the NEP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style etc.  If the NEP isn\u0026rsquo;t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.\nOnce the NEP is ready for the repository, the NEP editor will:\n  Assign an NEP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this NEP)\n  Merge the corresponding pull request\n  Send a message back to the NEP author with the next step.\n  Many NEPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Newton codebase. The NEP editors monitor NEP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.\nThe editors don\u0026rsquo;t pass judgment on NEPs.

It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of NEPs to a new champion. In general, we’d like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred NEP, but that’s really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the NEP process, or has fallen off the face of the net (i.e. is unreachable or isn’t responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don’t agree with the direction of the NEP. We try to build consensus around an NEP, but if that’s not possible, you can always submit a competing NEP.\nIf you are interested in assuming ownership of an NEP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the NEP editor. If the original author doesn’t respond to email in a timely manner, the NEP editor will make a unilateral decision (it’s not like such decisions can’t be reversed).\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/reviews/nep-review-0003/','title':"NEP Board Review 0003",'section':"Reviews",'content':"Results #     NEP No. Type Start/End Block Accepts Denies Rejects Result     NEP-12 update Draft 15756530/15876529 7 0 0 Accept   NEP-20 new Draft 15756497/15876496 7 0 0 Accept   NEP-21 new Draft 15756503/15876502 7 0 0 Accept   NEP-22 new Draft 15756508/15876507 7 0 0 Accept   NEP-23 new Draft 15756516/15876515 7 0 0 Accept   NEP-24 new Draft 15756523/15876522 7 0 0 Accept    Details #     Role Github ID NEW ADDR.

The release plan and curve will be the same as established.\nMotivation #  Newton has a release plan of 60B NEW to help the community develop. Since the project launched, the released NEW has been allocated to only one project, the current NewPay Community Node mining (Proof-of-Stake). To better grow the value of Newton as well as activate the community, here we propose a program called Newton Incentive Program to allocate budgets from the coming year release to support more mining projects in such aspects:\n to subsidize main-net machine nodes for realizing the opening of Newton ledgering network. to have more LPs (Liquidity Providers) for build a better liquidity, especially NEW/NUSDT, in NewSwap, for attracting more trades from centralized exchange (Huobi, etc) to our own on-chain exchange. to encourage community transferring their original Proof-of-Stake mining in NewPay to liquidity mining with their own community token in NewSwap, which will greatly help improving the value of Newton.  The first step and goal for the incentive program is to plan the budget of the coming year from the release plan, which is kept unchanged. If it works well in practice, there would be following programs in the next year and after, which will be decided later by the future community governance.\nAbstract #  The total supply of NEW is 100B, 60% of which is subjected to the community.\nIt can be divided into three parts as below:\n release will be implemented before 2021/2/1: 1545232707.3505096555 NEW one year budget (2021/2/1-2022/1/31) for incentives: 875130267.8946381786 NEW the rest: 57579637024.7548521659 NEW (will be decided by the future community governance)  The seconds part will be used for supporting the Newton Incentive Program.\nNewton Incentive Program #  The current NewPay node stake mining will be smoothly transitioned since 2021/2, then a Newton Incentive Program will be initiated:\nProgram budget: the same as above, No. 2\nThemes:\n   No Mining Theme Incentivized Behavior Budget Cap     1 Machine node Ledgering 20% (175026053.57892763572 NEW)   2 Pre-existing NewPay Community Node mining Maintaining community no less than 20% (175026053.57892763572 NEW)*   3 Liquidity mining for Community Token (cToken/NEW) Issuing tokens 30% (262539080.36839145358 NEW)   4 Liquidity minining for mainstream assets, such as NEW/NUSDT Providing liquidity 30% (262539080.36839145358 NEW)    The concrete allocation of the above budget will be laterly announced by each different implementation projects.\n*Comments: The pre-existing NewPay Community Node mining rewards will be continued. When one of the implementation projects of the Incentive Program is launched, its budget will be allocated from the total budget, and no more than the budget cap as listed above, that means the NewPay Community Node mining rewards will be reduced the same amount as allocated since then but guaranteed to be never less than 25%.\nImplementation #  Adoption of the content of this NEP requires the following phases:\nPhase 0.

Making the unlocking period the same as voters to unlock their staked NEW.\nAbstract #  In NewPay App, unlock NEW for Community Node owners/partners from their staked NEW will be changed from 14 days to 7 days to help them to get their NEW back faster. This requires changes to be made in NewPay App and related protocols and services.\nMotivation #  NewChain MainNet Nodes are open to the public to join after NEP-27 was proposed. And Newton Incentive Program was proposed in NEP-40, which creates more possibilities for the community to participates in the Newton eco-system and benefits from that.\nBefore NEP-27 and NEP-40, the majority community to get benefits from Newton Incentives was done by participating in Community Node Program in NewPay App. However, the Community Nodes management has to be done in NewPay App which runs on rules before NEP-27 and NEP-40 was proposed. Currently for Community Node owners/partners to unlock staked NEW to participate in other Newton Incentive Programs require 14 days, this reduces the flow of NEW in the whole Newton eco-system, also it creates inequality between the Community Node owners/partners and Community Node Voters to unlock their NEW.\nThis NEP is to reduce the complexities in Community Node management in NewPay App, make equality to all Community Node participants to unlock their NEW. As a result to encourage Community Node participants to use their NEW to participate in more Newton Incentive Programs.\nSpecification #  The unlocking period for Community Node will be set for 7 days for:\n Community Node owners to unlock staked NEW by reducing the locked amount, quitting Community Node. Community Node partners to unlock staked NEW by reducing the locked amount. Community Node voters to unlock staked NEW by reducing the locked amount.  This may be changed in the future by another NEP superseding this NEP.\nImplementation #  This proposal is planned to be implemented on:\n NewChain Testnet: 2021-03-17 NewChain Mainnet: 2021-03-19  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n"});index.add({'id':15,'href':'/neps/nep-51/','title':"Changes On Community NEW Budget Plan for 2022",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #  Referring to NEP-40, the NEW release schedule for 2022 is now planned.

The algorithm results in the base fee per gas increasing when blocks are above the gas target, and decreasing when blocks are below the gas target. The base fee per gas is burned. Transactions specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to give to miners to incentivize them to include their transaction (aka: priority fee). Transactions also specify the maximum fee per gas they are willing to pay total (aka: max fee), which covers both the priority fee and the block\u0026rsquo;s network fee per gas (aka: base fee). The transaction will always pay the base fee per gas of the block it was included in, and they will pay the priority fee per gas set in the transaction, as long as the combined amount of the two fees doesn\u0026rsquo;t exceed the transaction\u0026rsquo;s maximum fee per gas.\nNewton makes a unique improvement on this basis by setting a minimum value of BaseFee, that each gas has a minimum burn fee, to avoid the problem of low minimum burn value of each gas due to low network transaction volume. At the same time, the network fee for consensus layer transactions is exempted in order to be compatible with the characteristics of Newton consensus.\nMotivation #  Newton historically priced transaction fees using a simple auction mechanism, where users send transactions with bids (“gasprices”) and miners choose transactions with the highest bids, and transactions that get included pay the bid that they specify. At the same time, Newton node miners functioning normally are able to receive consensus layer rewards NEWNEW so that miners receive both the user\u0026rsquo;s transaction fee and the consensus layer rewards.\nAn important aspect of this fee system is that miners only get to keep the priority fee. The base fee is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol).This ensures that only NEW can ever be used to pay for transactions on Newton, cementing the economic value of NEW within the Newton platform. Additionally, this burn counterbalances Newton inflation while still giving the block reward and priority fee to miners. Finally, ensuring the miner of a block does not receive the base fee is important because it removes miner incentive to manipulate the fee in order to extract more fees from users.\nSpecification #  As of FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER, the BaseFee of per block MUST not less than BaseFeeMin where:\n BaseFeeMin is the minimum BaseFee and the value is 250000000000000  Note: // is integer division, round down.\nfrom typing import Union, Dict, Sequence, List, Tuple, Literal from dataclasses import dataclass, field from abc import ABC, abstractmethod @dataclass class TransactionLegacy: signer_nonce: int = 0 gas_price: int = 0 gas_limit: int = 0 destination: int = 0 amount: int = 0 payload: bytes = bytes() v: int = 0 r: int = 0 s: int = 0 @dataclass class Transaction2930Payload: chain_id: int = 0 signer_nonce: int = 0 gas_price: int = 0 gas_limit: int = 0 destination: int = 0 amount: int = 0 payload: bytes = bytes() access_list: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]] = field(default_factory=list) signature_y_parity: bool = False signature_r: int = 0 signature_s: int = 0 @dataclass class Transaction2930Envelope: type: Literal[1] = 1 payload: Transaction2930Payload = Transaction2930Payload() @dataclass class Transaction1559Payload: chain_id: int = 0 signer_nonce: int = 0 max_priority_fee_per_gas: int = 0 max_fee_per_gas: int = 0 gas_limit: int = 0 destination: int = 0 amount: int = 0 payload: bytes = bytes() access_list: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]] = field(default_factory=list) signature_y_parity: bool = False signature_r: int = 0 signature_s: int = 0 @dataclass class Transaction1559Envelope: type: Literal[2] = 2 payload: Transaction1559Payload = Transaction1559Payload() Transaction2718 = Union[Transaction1559Envelope, Transaction2930Envelope] Transaction = Union[TransactionLegacy, Transaction2718] @dataclass class NormalizedTransaction: signer_address: int = 0 signer_nonce: int = 0 max_priority_fee_per_gas: int = 0 max_fee_per_gas: int = 0 gas_limit: int = 0 destination: int = 0 amount: int = 0 payload: bytes = bytes() access_list: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]] = field(default_factory=list) @dataclass class Block: parent_hash: int = 0 uncle_hashes: Sequence[int] = field(default_factory=list) author: int = 0 state_root: int = 0 transaction_root: int = 0 transaction_receipt_root: int = 0 logs_bloom: int = 0 difficulty: int = 0 number: int = 0 gas_limit: int = 0 # note the gas_limit is the gas_target * ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER gas_used: int = 0 timestamp: int = 0 extra_data: bytes = bytes() proof_of_work: int = 0 nonce: int = 0 base_fee_per_gas: int = 0 @dataclass class Account: address: int = 0 nonce: int = 0 balance: int = 0 storage_root: int = 0 code_hash: int = 0 INITIAL_BASE_FEE = 1000000000 INITIAL_FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER = 10 # TBD BASE_FEE_MAX_CHANGE_DENOMINATOR = 8 ELASTICITY_MULTIPLIER = 2 BASE_FEE_MIN = 250000000000000 # Newton class World(ABC): def validate_block(self, block: Block) -\u0026gt;

In contrast, the NRC-50 Multi Token Standard allows for each token ID to represent a new configurable token type, which may have its own metadata, supply and other attributes.\nThe _id argument contained in each function’s argument set indicates a specific token or token type in a transaction.\nMotivation #  Tokens standards like NRC-6 and NRC-7 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, NRC-50 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.\nNew functionality is possible with this design such as transferring multiple token types at once, saving on transaction costs. Trading (escrow / atomic swaps) of multiple tokens can be built on top of this standard and it removes the need to “approve” individual token contracts separately. It is also easy to describe and mix multiple fungible or non-fungible token types in a single contract.\nSpecification #  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\nSmart contracts implementing the NRC-50 standard MUST implement all of the functions in the NRC50 interface.\nSmart contracts implementing the NRC-50 standard MUST implement the ERC-165 supportsInterface function and MUST return the constant value true if 0xd9b67a26 is passed through the interfaceID argument.\npragma solidity ^0.5.9; /** @title NRC-50 Multi Token Standard Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xd9b67a26. */ interface NRC50 /* is ERC165 */ { /** @dev Either `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` MUST emit when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers as well as minting or burning (see \u0026#34;Safe Transfer Rules\u0026#34; section of the standard).

Short-hand symbols are used in tickers and currency trading, but they aren’t as useful outside of that space.\nThe name function (for human-readable asset names, on-chain) was removed from the standard to allow the Metadata JSON to be the definitive asset name and reduce duplication of data. This also allows localization for names, which would otherwise be prohibitively expensive if each language string was stored on-chain, not to mention bloating the standard interface. While this decision may add a small burden on implementers to host a JSON file containing metadata, we believe any serious implementation of NRC-50 will already utilize JSON Metadata.\nUpgrades #  The requirement to emit TransferSingle or TransferBatch on balance change implies that a valid implementation of NRC-50 redeploying to a new contract address MUST emit events from the new contract address to replicate the deprecated contract final state. It is valid to only emit a minimal number of events to reflect only the final balance and omit all the transactions that led to that state. The event emit requirement is to ensure that the current state of the contract can always be traced only through events. To alleviate the need to emit events when changing contract address, consider using the proxy pattern, such as described in EIP-2535. This will also have the added benefit of providing a stable contract address for users.\nDesign decision: Supporting non-batch #  The standard supports safeTransferFrom and onERC1155Received functions because they are significantly cheaper for single token-type transfers, which is arguably a common use case.\nDesign decision: Safe transfers only #  The standard only supports safe-style transfers, making it possible for receiver contracts to depend on onERC1155Received or onERC1155BatchReceived function to be always called at the end of a transfer.\nGuaranteed log trace #  As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow, many dapps are relying on traditional databases and explorer API services to retrieve and categorize data. The NRC-50 standard guarantees that event logs emitted by the smart contract will provide enough data to create an accurate record of all current token balances. A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches of every NRC-50 token in the contract.\nApproval #  The function setApprovalForAll allows an operator to manage one’s entire set of tokens on behalf of the approver. It enables frictionless interaction with exchange and trade contracts.\nRestricting approval to a certain set of token IDs, quantities or other rules MAY be done with an additional interface or an external contract. The rationale is to keep the NRC-50 standard as generic as possible for all use-cases without imposing a specific approval scheme on implementations that may not need it. Standard token approval interfaces can be used, such as the suggested ERC-1761 Scoped Approval Interface which is compatible with NRC-50.\nTest Cases #  TBD\nImplementations #  TBD\nReferences #   ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155 ERC-721 Non-fungible Token Standard. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721 ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165 NRC6 Token Standard. https://github.com/newtonproject/NEPs/blob/main/NEPS/nep-6/index.md  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n"});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/neps/nep-23/','title':"NEAT Backed Currency (NBC)",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #   NEAT Backed Currency (NBC) is a kind of cryptographically secured currency following the design protocol of NEAT.

To create a new currency for exchange in a chosen community, certain community identity management system, and its account management system must be in place. For now, we will assume that the participants will start with existing Newton ID and NewKYC account management system. So that they will enjoy the same level of security. More over, all NEAT-backed Currency should follow the requirement as mentioned below:\n A currency must be guaranteed by a collateral asset, controllable under a cryptographically protected system, The entire transaction history will leverage NewChain\u0026rsquo;s secure timestamping services, The initial participating accounts will only include NewID and NewKYC, The exchangeable asset (currency) identities must be conserved and immutable (Quantitative Easing NOT ALLOWED), The participation of asset exchange can be defined by the NBC issuers and participants. Univalence: the security and value of cryptographically protected asset is defined by a unifying technical parameters of the security system. When there is a large number of NBCs, individual NBC\u0026rsquo;s technical security risk can be isolated from the market value fluctuation of a specific currency.  Motivation #  There are many organizational or community governance tasks that requires certain scoring or asset distribution system. To construct a secure system takes both technical know how and a significant amount of financial investment. NBC provides a solution to allow a larger number of people to create a small pool of assets, and allow these assets to be exchanged between participating parties. To make this system generally useful, the goal of NBC is to isolate the value of exchangeable asset from external marketplace as much as possible. Participants should measure and assess the value of the currency, purely on the security features of the exchange system, and a common clock of all exchange activities. This isolation of value judgement will significantly broaden the use of NBC, and allows more people to adopt this infrastructure of their own use. We list a number of possible usecase scenarios to motivate the design.\nSoftware Implementation and Content Development Communities #  A key component of value in cooperative content development or software development, is not often not the financial incentives, but the timing of content presentation. If an open source community has a high rate of bug-fixing responses, the overall user satisfaction will increase, therefore improve the ecology of the software user community as a whole. Therefore, the key incentive structure is to have a indifferent time keeper, that registers and rewards contributors of content, that most quickly resolves the issue. In other words, the currency in the community is response time. Clearly, the market value of the response time should be validated by the actual trajectory of content/software adoption curve. Therefore, the issuance of currency can be grounded on that type of data. In other words, having a system that distribute rewards based on commonly observed data, not just temporary market arbitrage activities for some external assets, such as USDT or other highly liquid asset, will protect the essential value of a localized currency.\nCommunity Services #  To mobilize community services, it is often necessary to keep a regular tab on how many times or how often certain services is delivered. For those contributors who are most regularly, or most frequently serving the community, a system like NBC could be the ledger of the fragmented community activities. For example, garbage pick-up and food deliver could be measured based on their record of being on-time. NBC could serve this area in helping teams to manage the quality of service using a combination of secure time stamps and other verifiable data.\nPhysical Security and Social Gathering/Distancing Measures #  A critical feature of Newchain is its 3 second resolution in data blocks. This highly responsive data update rates, provide a reasonable mechanism to help monitor the physical states of certain assets and define values based on the data records. For example, high density presence of mobile phones in a certain location, could indicate the physical location has high commercial/advertisement values, or large social distance risks. Therefore, issuing a currency based on this rather objective and publicly observable data set, can offer a meaningful metric to define the value of physical presence in certain time slots. This kind of applications can be better supported by NBC, when assets or score keeping systems are bound to the high-resolution Newchain timestamps.\nOther Applications in generalized digital workflow #  Any social or economic applications that deal with value changing with time could use NBC to measure the value created or dissipated over time. By focusing on the causal possibilities of offering solutions across the reachable locations within Newton Community, any account could contribute to or benefit from the publication of the availability of physical services or digital content. The timing and causal relations between any events, could be written up as motivating programs that identify certain patterns of behavior and direct resources for that behavior. This general programming paradigm is often called policy design. NBC provides a general purpose platform to develop executable policies under one infrastructure.\nSpecification #  Initially NBC just need to define the name of the currency, the total amount of its exchangeable units, and the conditions of who and when certain participants can exchange the declared units. For the purpose of human cognitive load, NBC will not allow quantitative easing, or splitting or stock, in any NBC. To make certain asset having more divisible resolution, one can transfer all the asset into a new NBC. That means, this division will require a significant amount of participant to agree with such transfer. In any case, NBC should be simple, so that people know what they are getting into and what they will face into the future. Once certain asset transfer policy is issued for an NBC, all existing asset will follow the same policy from that point onward. So that all asset valuation will attain certain consistency in value exchange.\nSyntax and Semantics #  The issuance of NBC can follow the following procedure:\n   Step Essential Term Explanation     1 Initial State Identify an unused name in the NBC registry   2 Guaranteed Deposit Certain initiator deposits certain valuable asset for the initial offering of NBC.   3 Exit Policy A self-executing \u0026ldquo;smart contract\u0026rdquo; will be written for how to redistribute the division of deposited asset when the NBC must be dissolved.   4 Immutable Division Define a total number of divisions for the newly created NBC. This cannot be changed ever   5 Distribution Rights The account that deposited the initial asset will have the right to distribute the divisions as created.   6 Participation Rights A \u0026ldquo;smart contract\u0026rdquo;, or a list of conditions for who in the Newton Community can participate in the exchange.   7 Rights to Expand Properties Any participant can increase the deposit   8 Backward Compatibility Any NBC account has the right to continue cash out residual value based on current exchange rates or the Exit Policy    Deployment Procedures #  The creation of NBC should follow a conservative stance. The goal is not to quickly create many exchangeable assets, so that many people could quickly create many gambling pools. The goal is to create a series of highly secure and useful patterns for governance. Therefore, the following policies should be obeyed to reduce, and ideally eliminate opportunistic creation of NBC.\n  All newly created NBC should have an initially high entrance barrier, such as a large deposit, and it should be locked down in months even years, so that it forces creators of new NBC would not be short term players.\n  All NBCs are some form of community or organizational governance instrument, so that its use and its performance data in real time is of great value. It should be protected and would follow the same kind of public disclosure and participants' identities would be protected using a set of security measures offered by the Newton Infrastructure.\n  Because all NBCs must be kept for as long as Newton Infrastructure exists. Therefore, a maintenance fee for its data and bandwidth consumption must be collected to support the infrastructure. This amount of fee needs to be dynamically adjusted based on the ongoing pricing of computation and communication costs at the time.\n  Rationale (optional) #  Allowing non-technical people to create NBC is the mission. However, there are much more governance techniques required to manage and orchestrate the communities that uses NBC. Currency issuance is clearly going to be a new dimension that organizations that adopts NBC must learn from the overall Newton Community. Therefore, a think tank organization that specializes in currency mechanism design must be initiated to develop material that shows NBC creators and participants to better practice their use of NBC. Currency is designed to be liquidable assets, so that it is a double edged swords. It must be used with tremendous care.\nTest Cases (optional) #  Newton Community itself should be the first one to practice the use of NBC. The currency should be the Newton currency as it is being used on the Internet.\nBefore we deploy the first NBC, certain kind of social dynamics and organizational infrastructure must be prepared. For example, one should use TLA+ and NetLogo to assess the symbolic dynamics and agent-based system dynamics of a group of participating agents. Then, a procedure will be deployed and submitted to the following Safety and Liveness tests. After certain iteration, we will deploy the actual NBC to Newton Community.\n Safety tests: After a meaningful NBC creation procedure is defined, a relatively small amount of Newton should be issued as a test case for NBC creation. Then, the community that develops NEPs and other mechanisms for Newton Community evolution should be organized through this NBC. Liveness tests: The cases where the first NBC is being used and how it affects the community could be the liveness case study.  Implementation #  Ideally, all Newton Community\u0026rsquo;s incentive and organizational structures should be managed through the governance procedures of NBC.\nSecurity Considerations #  To ensure security, creation of NBC must go through certain stress test and system test phases. The proposition here is that the first three years, all NBC creation should be submitted through both technical and branding committee, so that decisions for creating currencies would not contradict, or competing with each other for obvious reasons. Overtime, the competing interests should be encoded into some kind of Byzantine Fault Tolerance Mechanism.\nReferences #   Leslie Lamport, Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System, Communications of the ACM, July, 1978.

The effective date would be officially announced beforehand.\nPhase 1. Migration.\nPhase 1 would include the following steps:\nStep 1. Freeze.\n At a specific date and time announced in advance for at least 20 days, the \u0026ldquo;community node\u0026rdquo; feature will be frozen. No more \u0026ldquo;community node\u0026rdquo; would be allowed to create, and no \u0026ldquo;community node\u0026rdquo; would be allowed to unlock and quit, until the step 2 airdrop is finished. During the frozen period, all \u0026ldquo;community nodes\u0026rdquo; will receive daily mined NEW as usual, until step 2 airdrop.  Step 2. Migrate.\n The owner/creator of each \u0026ldquo;community nodes\u0026rdquo; (referred as \u0026ldquo;the node owner\u0026rdquo;) would be required to calculate the NEW staking amount and issue a token (called \u0026ldquo;cToken\u0026rdquo;) for this node with exactly the same amount of the total supply. NewAsset Generator could be used for this task.  cToken definition: Symbol: 2-4 letters abbreviated from the node name, for example, ABC. Name: the node name. Amount: exactly the same amount with the staking amount of NEW in this node as frozen in step 1. Precision: 18 Mintability: DISABLED. The node owner will then submit an application to NewSwap for joining the Node Mining Area of NewSwap. The node owner would be required to transfer 100% of the issued cToken to NewSwap airdrop address, for being distributed to original node stakeholders through on-chain airdrop, according to the staked NEW in a pro rata basis. All the cToken will be airdropped to each specific person who staked NEW in this \u0026ldquo;community node\u0026rdquo; via either founding/co-founding the node or voting for the node. The \u0026ldquo;community node\u0026rdquo; will be unfrozen, for everyone to unlock the staked NEW immediately. The original NEW mining will be stopped at the same time. The node owner will create a liquidity pool for the cToken paired with NEW and put the cToken and NEW (in a reasonable ratio in your rationale and as you wish) into the liquidity pool and get the LP tokens of cToken-NEW. Each who joins the liquidity pool can then put the cToken-NEW LP tokens into the Node Mining Area of NewSwap for being ready to mine NEW. Later on, the person can read the mining contract to check out the amount of LP tokens he/she owns, and withdraw them as he/she wants.  The roadmap and deadline for this step will be announced before the migration begins.\nStep 3. Yield Farming.\n Once all the \u0026ldquo;community nodes\u0026rdquo; are settled and all cToken-NEW LP tokens are correctly locked up into the mining contract as the announce deadline in step 2, the liquidity mining will be activated. Farmers, i.e. LP token owners, will receive NEW for yield farming. All farmers will share a certain amount of NEW yielded with each block. The amount of NEW received will be decided by the following formula:   locked LP token amount * LP token price against NEW ------------------------------------------------------ * the amount of NEW yielded with a certain block ∑(LP token amount * LP token price against NEW) Please note that the LP token price against NEW will be updated once a day for the performance consideration on the smart contract execution.\nThe mined NEW are generated from NewPool daily release. For more information on the NewPool release, please refer to NEP-27 NewChain MainNet Opening.  Step 4. Join and Leave.\nJoin:\n Prepare a certain amount of NEW, for example, 1,000,000 NEW. Issue a token that will be used as cToken, with the same amount of the NEW in point 1, and the mintability disabled. NewAsset Generator could be used for this task. Create the liquidity pool with cToken:NEW (in a reasonable ratio in your rationale and as you wish) and get all the LP tokens. Submit an application for joining the Node Mining Area. Once it is correctly configured, the applicant can then put his/her LP tokens into the mining contract to start yield farming.  Leave:\n Just simply remove the LP tokens from the mining contract.  Step 5. End.\nAfter 1 year yield farming, the Node Mining Area will be closed.\nCopyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n"});index.add({'id':28,'href':'/neps/nep-22/','title':"Newton Composite Asset (NCA)",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #  Newton Composite Asset (NCA) is the base pattern of asset combination that defines the boundary of how two or more than two assets are combined as a single instance. NCA distinguishes from the other types of asset by involving more than one NEAT. Every NCA is defined based on the principle of Behavioral Equivalence 1, so that unique properties of NCA can be distinguished computationally and therefore maximize the possibility of code reuse and automated asset valuation.\nNCA creates value through patterns of asset composition. By definition of composition, every NCA is a combination of two or more than two NEATs. The required engineering of how combined NEATs can generate more value than their independent existence, a package that is more than the sum of its parts, is a major source for its value creation. Economically speaking, if components of an NCA can be bought or sold separately as independent NEATs, there would be little necessity to bundle them together as an NCA. Therefore, it is the compositional pattern that defines the unique value of the system as a collective makes an NCA more valuable than the sum of its parts. Effectively, NCA is the programmable device to define NEAT Portfolios. From a practical standpoint, NCA is where value can be created via combinatorial possibilities, when validated by marketplace, is a true form of productivity. In general, all NCA are uniquely prescribed by the content of its portfolio. When the portfolio contains any one item that is non-fungible, the portfolio are considered to be a Non-Fungible NCA. If the NCA are composed of assets that are all replaceable, then, the NCA is considered to be Fungible NCA. Furthermore, when NCA can be broken up to divisible portions, they are considered to be Divisible NCA. When they must be sold in complete packages, they are considered to be Non-Divisible.\n Abstract #  Newton Composite Asset (NCA) is an asset class that defines value through a composition of more than one NEAT components. NCA is the generic data type to define \u0026ldquo;smart contracts\u0026rdquo; in Newton Infrastructure, where economical vehicles can be created out of other existing NEAT-based components. It is equivalent to a program composed of many transactional functions that already existed in the trust-worthy platform.\nMotivation #  In contrast to individual NEAT, NCA is composed of multiple NEATs, whose validation and execution of composed transactions must take extra efforts and maintain. Therefore, the value of an NCA should be greater than the sum of its parts. This is also considered to be the way Newton Community can create new value by defining various ways to combine existing sub-classes of NEATs to create new asset classes combinatorially. This is the place where new value can be generated by having creative minded agents and agencies to select meaningful composition of assets, and perform analysis of their combined values. Then, it is up to the creator of the NCA to programmatically define the price and conditions of transaction of all available NEATs across the Newton Community. This allows any agents or agencies in the Newton Community members to contribute their creativity in terms of how to combine NEATs into NCAs.\nIt is well-known that assets have different values in different spatial and temporal contexts. In most well-known marketplaces, goods and services are often sold when needs arise. The realization of value is often passive. For example, the price of umbrella is often more valuable during rainy days, medical equipments can become particularly valuable when certain diseases become a major threat. These contextual valuation is often realized passively, when event arises. However, such pricing approach not only could cause unreasonable price gauging, in most cases, the supply of goods and services could often be incompatible with the actual needs. Since many of these time-based needs can be overlooked in \u0026ldquo;normal days\u0026rdquo;. NCA provides a vehicle to combine resources in a time-bound transaction. Therefore, many of these time-based transactions can be planned ahead of time. So that foreseeable needs can be planned ahead of time in the process of designing NCA. In theory, when needs are anticipated before needs arises, the pricing of needed goods and services would naturally consider the issue of supply chain capability. Therefore, there would be relevant efforts to fulfill the needs as anticipated. In practice, when certain needs repeatedly occur, new classes of NCA would be created as the community learns about the needs in reality. Therefore, the overall community would become more capable in reaching reasonable supply and demand dynamics.\nAsset Valuation Techniques #  Analyzing the values of NCA requires a new breed of simulation tools. Since the market value of asset is bounded to a societal context, and the future of this realistic context always have certain uncertainty. The best possible approach is to provide a common Asset Valuation Simulation platform, so that the value of any NCA will be priced based on the simulation, with participant\u0026rsquo;s private investments or insurance policies.\nUser Experience Design of NCA #  NCA\u0026rsquo;s user interface should have a common base-design. Since all NCA are made of other instances of NEAT-based assets, a common navigation interface must be provided for all NCA. So that user would have a consistent experience in identifying and comparing NCAs.\nImmutability and irrefutability #  Every NCA is a unique combination of NEAT assets. So that once it is created, the compositional content cannot be changed.\nNCA\u0026rsquo;s names in NEAT Namespace #  NCA can be represented as a registered name in NEAT\u0026rsquo;s namespace. It should be a subclass of NEAT, having its sub-Namespace code segment. This unification of NCA in NEAT will significantly reduce the complexity of NCA management.\nSpecification #  As mentioned in NEAT, the foundational building blocks of NCA is NEAT. The composition of NEAT into NCA is based on pi-Calculus. Every NCA is defined as follows:\n NCA, NEAT := Receive asset *a* from Transaction Channel *C*, run NEAT or NCA; Send asset *a* over Transaction Channel *C*, then, run NEAT or NCA; Concurrently Execute NEAT and NCA, and test NCA's composition rules; Create a new Transaction Channle *X*, run NCA; Repeat multiple instances of NCA or NEAT; Terminate all NCA and NEAT transactions;  Syntax and Semantics #  NCA is a composite data structure defined by NEATs or other instances of NCA. As shown above, NCA can be defined recursively. The legitimacy of NCA is defined by the temporal and logical prescription of each NEAT, for example, if certain assets requires the concurrent availability of other collateral assets, such as meat delivery must be accompanied by refrigeration service, then, relevant temporal logic conditions must be satisfied. By embedding logical and temporal conditions within each NCA, the NCA composition is the executable logic that defines whether certain contract is considered fulfilled or breached. NCA can be composed of any number of existing NEATs. For example, it can be a combination of existing NPA (Physical Assets), NBC (Newton-backed Currencies), and NPC (Newton Prepaid-Card). By specifying the asset components of an NCA, it also automatically check the temporal and logical validity of these composited asset, so that all transactions are automatically verified statitically, and dynamically, based on a common data type, NEAT.\nA unique feature of NCA is the creator. Since every NCA spells out a unique composition of asset content, its creator is like an artist/author, that creates a unique portfolio of assets. Therefore, the account, or accounts that create such composition, should be associated with this value creation process, and should be responsible for the rewards and possible damages of this value composition.\nMeta Data #     Item Description Behaviors/Properties     Creation Input     Creator Accounts The Newton Account identities that creates the said NCA deploy/can not be changed   Associated NEATs A list of NEAT involved with this NCA at least one NEAT   Portfolio Rules A composition that describes the quantity and sequence of NEAT/NCA rule should be described in pi-Calculus   Status The status of NCA is can be separated into following kinds: Proposed, Tested, Verified, Executed, Decommissioned a finite set of status classes   ** Evolution History **     Developmental History A list of time points when NCA is created and modified new timestamps are added as changes made   Execution History A list of NCA execution time points, including reference to executed NCAs immutable data records    Rationale #  NCA is a way to leverage compositional efforts to create value. Such compositional value creation can be best illustrated by Bitcoin as a currency. Since Bitcoin as a system creates market value through a composition of three communities, they are:\n A community of Miners: a large number of administratively independent machines, that agrees on a common transaction ledger. A community of Traders: a large number of accounts and agents who are transferring funds between different accounts. A community of Coders: an open sourced community that keeps improving and fixing source code the offers better and more secure software functionalities.  The value of NCA comes from its composition of complementary functions. Separately, each community has relatively limited value constrained by their physical surroundings. Once combined through Bitcoin, or some form of NCA, the credibility of assets and ubiquity of asset liquidity becomes pervasive. Effectively, this three way composition of Miner, Traders, and Coder accounts, brings together a living entity that is distributed across the globe, and works around the clock, unstoppably. Similarly, there will be many forms of assets that can be composed to broaden its value across space and time. The role of NCA as a root class of other NCAs, is to provide a template the covers how asset valuation can be done, how to design user interfaces for other NCAs, and demonstrate the immutable and irrefutable values of assets. Last but not least, the value in Namespace, is the foundation of asset management, and how NCA plays in the Namespace must abide to a set of non-negotiable rules.\nHigh Level Architecture #  NCA is essentially a composed NEAT contract that needs the widest possible reachability to the marketplace. For NCA to exists, it must first be created. The creation process should follow the typical DevOps/CI/CD type development cycle. The DevOps/CICD workflow is often associated with the idea of Event Sourcing, short handed as ES. For trivial combination of NEATs, simple user interface that allows users to combine NEATs into portfolio of NEATs would be a starting point. Once any NCA is created with existing NEATs, a sequence of testing and validation procedure must be applied, so that programmatically detectable conflicts can be first conducted before the created NCA is released to the marketplace.\n It can be thought of as a typical exchange matching engine, when the ask/bid combinations are matched, the transaction would take place. In short, it can be simply considered as a marketplace of NCAs, and they can be bought and sold as if they are listed entries of stock or futures in current market practice. Knowing the transactional nature of NCA, the design of NCA exchange marketplace can be implemented using the existing exchange engine that is commonly designed to execute stock or virtual currency trades. As mentioned earlier, the buyer/seller matching algorithm should be based on some automated algorithms. These algorithms should following the Behavioral Equivalence 1 properties. One way to defining such property is to classify NCAs that are ready to be exchanged in terms of Behavioral Equivalences. So that all transactions can automatically take place based on the pre-processed classification.\nA rather complete architectural diagram based on CQRS-architectural pattern could be referenced to implement the overall system. The diagram was originally created to explain the CQRS-Event Sourcing concept by Daniel Whittaker. Implementation #  There are two aspects of NCA implementation. The first one is NCA creation by combining NEATs. The second one is to release NCAs into a public marketplace to be traded. The first one should be an exercise of user interface design and automated testing. As mentioned in the High Level Architecture, the automated testing should follow priniciples prescribed by [1] Behaviral Equivalence of said NCAs. The testing can be conducted using formal model checking tools such as TLA+ or to be implemented in Coq.\nThe second one is a matching engine that allows traders to quickly search for their desirable NCAs and allow buyers and sellers to easily find their targets. The implementation of matching and transactional engine can be implemented using Event Sourcing and CQRS-based implementation models. For the choice of software stack, Apache-Kafka is a high performance platform that can execute up to millions of transactions per second.\nReferences #  \n Rocco De Nicola, Behavioral Equivalences, [ Research Gate], [ L-Università ta' Malta]  \n Alex Pentland, Alexander Lipton, and Thomas Hardjono, Building the New Economy, [MIT Press]  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC BY-SA 4.0.\n"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/neps/nep-20/','title':"Newton Encoded Asset Transaction (NEAT)",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #  Newton Encoded Asset Transaction(NEAT) defines the root data type for all asset exchanges. Once a new record of NEAT is registered into Newchain, it represents a form of irrefutable accountability based on the immutable features of Newchain. To help transaction assess the worthiness of transactions before their commitment, all transactions have a common field, called: Bounded Accountability, which defines all known exit conditions when a transactional process is breached. From an economic viewpoint, the security of every transaction must be insured by worthwhile collateral assets, which include the reputation history of the exchange participants. To make transactions trust-worthy, all transactions must be encoded as an executable algorithm, and all human initiated asset exchange execution are authorized by cryptographically ensured procedures. NEAT delivers Bounded Accountability of transactions by representing transactions based on\n trust-worthy timestamps, irrefutable asset identities, non-repudiable agreement actions, deposited collaterals.  NEAT can be seen as a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that is dedicated to represent transactional accountability. The domain represented by DSL is the domain of transactions, since all subsequent transactions are reprented by the root data class, NEAT. More importantly, only NEAT and its subclasses will be recorded on Newchain, which will become durable and accountable in the history of NEAT execution. As a DSL, NEAT provides a small, yet expressive vocabulary of asset types, so that practical business transactions can be composed of NEAT to represent a broad range of economic activities with computable risk profiles with a common field: Bounded Acountability. NEAT presents a small set of asset types as its linguistic primitives. For instance, NewID/NewKYC accounts, NEP-21: Newton Physical Asset, NEP-22: Newton Composite Asset. It is based on these primitives, applications such as NEP-23: NEAT-backed Currency, NEP-24: Newton Prepaid-Card can be defined for practical use. The notion of Buy, Sell, Borrow, and Bid, are the actions or verb primitives of NEAT. The runtime execution of NEAT is carried out by NewKernel, and all transactional records will be immutably stored on Newchain. The following diagram outlines the architecture of the NEAT execution environment.\n Abstract #  Newton Encoded Asset Transaction (NEAT) is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that represents asset transactions with computable Bounded Accoutability. The goal of NEAT is to provide a rigorous language to construct asset portfoilios on an exchange platform to facilitate asset-sharing practice. NEAT facilitates sharing by always make both providers and receivers of the asset accountable of their actions in terms of bounded collaterals. Every NEAT-based transaction must have computable and verifiable data items that represent the accountability of the transaction participants. In other words, all participants must earn their reputation over time, or they must deposit a reasonable amount of asset to insure their own transactional actions. With Newton\u0026rsquo;s immutable ledger and accounts represented by NewID, accounts with good credit history will be able to carry more trust-worthiness and will be given more freedom in practicing wider ranges of commercial activities. To instill accountability to every NEAT-based transactions, every transaction is associated with the following security features:\n every transaction should be guaranteed by a set of collateral asset, deposited by participants of the transactions or the transaction platform. all transactions must be tagged with secure timestamping services, public keys for participating accounts (NewID and NewID-based NewKYC), globally defined asset identities (IPv6, MAC Address, and other IoT and asset-specific tags) composable semantics of delivery/reception mechanisms based on pi-calculus. Univalence: All NEAT utilizes a unifying security model, the degree of security should be measured by equivalent units, measured in Newton. Newton as a currency is bound to physical time.  NEAT as a DSL for Transactional Operations #  From the highest abstraction level, all transactions are composed of three main types of operations, Selling, Buying and Matching of Buyer/Sellers. These three operations are to be recorded into an immutable transactional datastore, as shown in the following diagram:\n The most common states are listed in the following table:\n   Function Description Permission     Ready for More Transactions Allow additional transactions to be processed on NEAT. System Level   Initiate Transaction Allow NewID accounts to intiate new Transactions NewID Accounts   Seller Ops Create a new offerings to be bought, including credit and offering validations NewID Accounts   Buyer Ops Create a new bid to obtain products or services NewID Accounts   Matching Ops Match Buyer(s) and Seller(s) based on NEAT Contract System Level   Transaction Completion After all commitments are checked, automatically store transaction records on Newchain System Level   Failed Transaction Conditions Terminate Transaction based on contractual conditions. System Level   Bounded Accountability Every NEAT and its subclasses will be associated with one entry of Bounded Accountability System Level (Editable Once by the NewID account of Initiate Transaction)    Technically speaking, NEAT is a domain-specific language with a immutable transaction ledger and a unifying real-world clock. It can be expanded to encode other types of transactions that follows this generic pattern. The main objectives of creating NEAT is about creating a unifying namespace to , so that knowledge derived from operating this transactional ledger can be uniformly shared to improve the soundness and precision of transaction accountability. NEAT as an abstract specification of a DSL in the Domain of Bounded Accountability is not limited to a specific stack of software/hardware technologies. However, NEAT\u0026rsquo;s initial reference implementation will be bound to the archietctual patterns of Serverless Applications, Function as a Service (FaaS), Event Sourcing, Command Query Resposibility Segregation (CQRS), and the process patterns, DevOps, GitOps, and MLOps. These architectural guidelines will limit the technical discussion, and engineering implementation to a specific level of data abstraction, particularly bounded to time-oriented namespace management. This temporally-oriented design principle will permeate the overall engineering efforts, including the design and implementation of human-data interaction interfaces.\nMotivation #  NEAT is about providing a unifying, and formally verifiable data type that represents asset transaction activities on Newchain. The motivation to unify transactional data on one formally verifiable data type is to avoid human intervention without valuable collaterals and maximize knowledge reuse with respect to transaction processing. This data type would allow anyone with a Newchain account to participate in a transparent and unbiased asset transaction service, purely defined by executable logical contracts. The accountability of transactional activities is grounded in Newchain, whose infrastructure provides trust-worthy facts through irrefutable account-based actions and immutable event occurrence sequence. To maximize knowledg reuse, NEAT is defined as the root class for all other types of transaction. Having one unifying base class, provides a discipline to organize and compare the differences between all transaction processing strategies. This unity will significantly reduce the complexity of system development and maintenance, therefore minimize the transaction processing cost (cost of middleman).\nTime-bound ACID Transactions #  A key feature of NEAT is the notion of Bounded Accountability. The security of accountability is to ensure by data security, often prescribed as the ACID properties of transaction, Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. The \u0026ldquo;economic value\u0026rdquo; or transactional accountability is bounded by the \u0026ldquo;correctness\u0026rdquo; of contract execution during runtime. Therefore the correctness is also bounded by a time window, from the time point of contract initiation, up to the point of contract fulfillment or failure acknowledgement. Knowing that Newchain is an non-stoppable real-time immutable data store infrastructure, participants of NEAT-based transactions can judge the boundaries of accountability based on the physically meaningful timestamps, and ACID properties associated with data transactions. All claims of accountability must be follow the consistency in timestamped records to infer their respective judgemental outcomes. Combining this timestamped data with formal data analysis tools, such as the System Specificatin language: TLA+ 9. An abstract specification language such as TLA+, can be used to define the possibility space of accountability in temporal dimensions, and allow the possibility state space to be symbolically enumerated and examined by participants prior to commiting to certain transaction. Therefore, either transaction participants conduct extensive verification processes using formally defined logic, or they simply declare the admission of bounded risks, and therefore agree to the said Bounded Accoutability. By explicitly denoting transactions with a computable field: \u0026ldquo;Bounded Accountability\u0026rdquo;, such data field provides a formal structure to express risk profiles of all transactional activities uniformally. All risks that participants are willing to take can be expressed in a set of objectively defined risk assessment statement executable by temporal logic.\nTemporal Logic Reasoning Engine: Behavioral Equivalence #  To make NEAT pratical, yet pertains sufficient robustness from error, the vocabulary of NEAT, will need to be incrementally refined to fit the changing application contexts. The refinement process will be supported by formal method tools, such as TLA+. Tools such as TLA+ will first denote distinguishable transactional states of transaction activities, and then, use these time-based state notation to classify different kinds of asset transaction activities. This is also where the overall system establish equivalence between transactional processes with different names. Then, these classified transactional activities can be assigned context-dependent terms, and these terms will be managed in a globally managed NEAT reserve word dictionary. This global dictionary of NEAT defines equivalent classes of transactional behavior, so that all transactional behavior will be grounded in the namespace of formal analysis, not in the context-dependent namespace. Grounding all transaction models with a formal behavioral representation allows the NEAT system to evolve around abstract specifications. Concrete implementation and operational data will also be referenced in the overall knowledge base, but they will only serve in a supportive role for evolving the NEAT language.\nVocabulary Management in Wiki #  As NEAT gets applied in operational contexts, natural language synonyms of these formally defined vocabulary will be slowly admitted to the dictionary of alias, published in a distributed wiki database. This wiki database provides a common repository for participants to publish and read the definition of different types of transactional activities. The natural language oriented content of Wiki, allows many kinds of people ,allowing non-technical people to better engage with NEAT. The design and evolution of NEAT, will follow the methodology of Domain Deriven Design(DDD), where the domain is grounded in temporal logic. Knowing that time arrow will always increase entropy, the namespace of NEAT will simply be version controlled using uniquely defined time-stamps on Newchain. In other words, the version control mechanism of NEAT\u0026rsquo;s dictionary is grounded in Newchain\u0026rsquo;s timestamp sequence. This grounding uniquely combines namespace management with the trust-worthy time-stamping service provided by Newchain, an entropy-based namespace management strategy can naturally classify increasingly complex transaction types, and therefore define all the namespace of known transaction types under one unified dictionary. Intentially maintain logical consistency through the use of one trust-worthy timestamp service, the namespace evolution governed by the second law of thermodynamics will provide the cornerstone to unify the developmental approaches to transaction processes. This time-bound namespace management strategy will support an future-proof transactional processing infrastructure that maximally avoid redundancy in the development and maintenance of transaction processing services.\nUser Experience Design surrounds Time, Immutability and Irrefutability #  NEAT is designed to support transactional activities between humans. Therfore, the irrefutability of NEAT can be accepted when human participants can consciously agree with transactional actions and records. Participant awareness is built-in a common user experience design framework by following three key human interaction components:\n Actions defined by a time-bound namespace: Users need to know that all transactional actions are distinguished by a unifying timestamp system. The uniqueness of their actions are guaranteed by an irreversible sequence. Record Immutability: Once finished, all transactional records goes into an \u0026ldquo;immutable\u0026rdquo; state, meaning that NEAT records will never be changed after it is committed. Irrefutable accountability: Once participant agrees to do something at certain time point, the irreversibiliy and immutability of this transaction system make the decision maker accountable for their earlier decision. All decision are final at the time points of transaction execution.  In other words, since all other transactions are defined under the umbrella of NEAT, by designing a set of User Interfaces guidelines to ensure human participants are aware of time, immutability, and irrefutability, the transactional system can be accountably deployed to the public.\nSpecification #  Technically, NEAT is designed as a base transactional language with time-bound trust-worthiness. It defines a set of foundational syntax and vocabulary in a structured namespace, specifically organized in Newton Asset Namespace (NAM). NAM provides a unifying framework to named implementations of encryption algorithms, secure timestamp mechanisms, and account security based on Newchain. By using a formalized namespace to manage the identities of the assets being exchanged, and the secured mechanisms of how this asset is being delivered, NEAT provides a unifying exchange protocol for all asset exchange bookkeeping between its community members. NEAT being the root class of asset transaction records, allows other types of assets to be encoded following or extending the possible definitions of asset transaction activities. This data structure is independent of the particular kind of assets that it is being exchanged.\nNEAT Syntax #  NEAT is a base class that can be extened to make up Newton Composite Asset (NCA), that are composed of multiple instances of NEATs. The syntax for defining composed NEAT and its composed structure, NCA, is based on pi-Calculus. pi-Calculus is the formalism of encoding processes and their interactions as a rewrite system. Every NEAT is defined as follows:\nNCA, NEAT := Receive and Send asset a from Transaction Channel C, run NEAT or NCA; Concurrently Execute NEAT and NCA; Create a new Transaction Channle X, run NCA; Repeat multiple instances of NCA; Terminate all NCA transactions; More detail of NEAT syntax will be explained in NEP-22: Newton Composite Asset, because data asset is compositional in nature, and the data content of a NEAT is almost always composed of other data types.\nNEAT Semantics #  The uniqueness of NEAT is defined by a combination of transactional channel C, asset a, time t, and a hashcode of Executing Condition h(E). In practice, all NEAT must have access to collaboral asset CA, and a set of reimbusement rule RR given different conditions during breach of contract. The meaning of the variable names mentioned above are defined here:\n   Variable Name Annotation Explaination     NEAT NEAT_p, NEAT_q represents distinct instance of NEAT named transactions based on the unique combination of C(x,y), a, t (Time), and a Hashcode of Executing Conditions   C(x,y) Account names: (Issuing Account)+ \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; (Receiving Accounts)+ The direction of asset transfer: x Issuing Accounts -\u0026gt; y Receiver Accounts   a Asset IDs : (Asset ID)_ \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; (Asset ID)_ a represents the set of (Asset ID)* to be transferred to from x to y   t Time: (Newchain timestamp)+ A sequence of timepoints of actual transactional events marked by (Newchain timestamp)+   E Executing Conditions: (Deliver Condition)+ \u0026lsquo;:\u0026rsquo; (Reception Condition)+ (Deliver Condition)+ \u0026lsquo;:\u0026rsquo; (Reception Condition)+ are two set of rules that defines the delivery and reception conditions of asset right transfer. Maybe associated with timestamp information shown in (3).   CF Comment Field: (Natural Language content that describes the contract) A field dedicate for human understanding, like the Ricardian Contract. The comments of NEAT can be written in a formatted template, the format could follow Logic Model.   CA Collateral Asset: (Asset ID)+ Collateral asset as a guarantee for participants of this transaction. This is usually defined by the insurance policy for the amount of resources to be issued to participants when transactions failed. (Asset ID)+ should be a set of transferrable assets that will be ditributed in case the transaction fails. Initially, this can be certain amount of Newtons made available to insure the risk coverage of possible transaction failure modes.   RR Reimbursement Rules: (Rule for Reimbursement)+ A contract explicitly defines how to reimburse the participants when the transaction failed to work. The allocation of funds should be independent of the creator of this NEAT type. (Rule for Reimbursement)+: An automated executable contract, written in scripts that would allocate the available cryptographically ensured funds to participants according to various deliver/reception status. The creator of the executable contract should demonstrate that they are NOT in positions of conflict of interest.    Human Interface Design #  Since all subsequent information are subclasses of NEAT data and its organized by a unifying logical clock. It would be necessary to present a unifying user interface to present these temporal data at different scales. The design method can consider the formalism presented by Chris Stolte et al, in their Multiscale Data Cubes approach 8(http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/pan_zoom/paper.pdf).\nExplicit Guarantees #  The value guaranteed by NEAT can be supported by the following explicit guarantees:\n Collateral Assets: all NEAT should have assets dedicated to guarantee the integrity of the transaction. Prior Transaction Records: the historical records of how the identical or similar NEAT was executed with immutable historical data. Mechanized Proofs: The \u0026ldquo;Executing Conditions\u0026rdquo; is the explicit contract that spells out the boundary conditions of how transactions are fulfilled. It should be accompanied by a set of testable conditions, that has an accompanying mechanized proof program to statically check the logical integrity of \u0026ldquo;Executing Conditions\u0026rdquo;. Overtime, the \u0026ldquo;Executing Conditions\u0026rdquo; can be enriched based on operational data to avoid any conflict of interests. Strength of Cryptographic Protection: The system assumes that account actions are initiated by agents who didn\u0026rsquo;t lose their passwords or their cryptographic system are asserted to be in tact. For low risk and low value transactions, cryptographic systems with lower degree of security can be guaranteed by having some form of collabteral assets.  By allowing these three types of explicit guarantees, the value of each NEAT is protected and transaction data recorded on the chain. This also helps to isolate the dependencies between different NEAT, in case some transactions or businesses caused any suspectable results, their problems can be totally independent from other NEAT. The overarching idea is to accommodate all levels of security and asset guarantees based on a lattice-based security classification system. In other words, the levels of guarantee are given a consistent lattice-based namespace to make the risk exposure to be explicit.\nRationale of Bounded Accountability #  The acountability of NEAT transactions are insured by a set of complementary mechanisms, such as security levels characterized in cryptographics, the amount of deposited collaterals, and the algorithmic properties of mechanized proofs. All transactions are assume to only carry risk levels up to the parameterized boundary, therefore, having a set of certified human-machine interfaces, and the relevant computable implementations of Bounded Accountability are essential features of NEAT. When assets are considered to be more valuable than the representable insurance policy, these mechanisms, including human-machine interfaces should prevent assets to be engaged in a NEAT transaction. This protective mechanism works both for the human participants, as well as the NEAT operating infrastructure. On the side of human participants, NEAT exchange should only be initiated after certain security deposit or prior reputation can cover the allowed Bounded Accountability. On the operational side, by parameterizing risk profiles in terms of computable/decidable terms, it becomes possible to automatically assess a large number of transactions in a wide range of application contexts. In other word, the notion of Boundary is determined by the computability of risk parameters. Without presenting risk profiles in terms of computationally representable and effectively computable expressions, it would be impossible to ochestrate the astronomical volume and types of transactional activities that can be automatically conducted using currently existing Internet of Things infrastructure.\nBalancing Security Protection Pragmatically #  The above mentioned guarantee mechanisms together form a mutually dependent protection ecology. A NEAT without the protection of sound cryptographic security system, or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have an automatically verifiable proof, the participants should not put down too much Collateral Assets to guarantee the specific NEAT transaction. On the other hand, when the maturity of NEAT \u0026ldquo;executable conditions\u0026rdquo; are throughly tested both operationally with historical records, and mechanical proof results, then, it would be much likely that such NEAT is going to deserve larger amount of collateral assets. The key idea is that NEAT is a platform to allow participants to dynamically construct a bounded security using existing infrastructure, without waiting for all four conditions to reach perfection.\nFreedom in Constructing Transactional Contracts #  The transactions of digitally representable assets can be best illustrated by the four fundamental rights as explained by Richard Stallman\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Free Software, Free Society\u0026rdquo;[ available here].\n   Free Software pi-Calculus Concept     The right to use Software The choice to engage certain interactive process (Human choose to use certain piece of software)   The right to understand the working mechanisms of Software Parallel execution of the software, including mirror the understanding of the working principles   The right to modify the software for other Uses Change the software in ways that covers the way it didn\u0026rsquo;t work before (Prohibit or enable certain new functions)   The right to re-distribute the modified Software Replicate the software/data asset in alternative distribution channels (Re-distribution for profit)    Leveraging the fundamental rights to the four composable rules, one can define a way to cover a wide range of data asset transaction scenarios that have been investigated for decades by prior luminaries, such as Richard Stallman, Robin Milner, and Leslie Lamport.\nImplementation #  High Level Architecture Design Principles #  NEAT as a generic format of transaction, is the data structure that controls the states for all asset transfer. It is also an extensible programming language with a particular application domain. Its syntax, semantics and pragmatics can be defined using formal language modeling tools, such as the K Framework. Overtime, the system does NOT need be bound to specific tools or speicific implementations. For example, NEAT can be implemented using hand coded C, or automatically generated code modeled on K Framework. NEAT\u0026rsquo;s underlying time-oriented data store, do not necessarily need to be bound to blockchain-based transaction model. Any transaction model that fulfills the notion time-based Bounded Accountability, as specified by the abstract specification will be admitted. This document is intended to be written as an implementation neutral specification, that can be examined in terms of abstract logical arguments, not in terms of the run time performance of engineering artifacts. Therefore, this document is intentionally written as an abstract specification of NEAT, and its implementation should be separated from this specification. At the same time, NEAT is also an operational platform, it needs to leverage existing engineering wisdom and tools that has already demonstrated scalability and technical sophistication. So that the following section will present the guidance in implementing a scalable NEAT infrastructure.\nEvent Sourcing, CQRS, and DDD #  Since NEAT is highly depedent on time, the software implmentation strategy should be aligned with known architectural patterns that provides time-sensitive data structures. For example, to implment concurrent systems, adopting event sourcing 10 patterns such as CQRS 10 (Command Query Resposibility Segregation), and define transactions in terms of their business domains using DDD (Domain-driven Design), are high level architectural designs that do not directly involve coding. By separating design from implementation has many long term advantages, and allow implementation decisions to be based on architectural arguments, not based on implementation details.\nThe focus of NEAT is all about secure real-time transactions, that means performance is of utmost critical concern. Using design patterns such as Event Sourcing, it is possible to better investigate broadly applicable design solutions without involving source code level experiments. More importantly, it allows implementers to systematically search for industrial strength solutions that are designed to solve these fundamental, system-level issues, such as security, high performance, irrefutable transaction processing. Even if these technical solutions are solved by our own implementation, it should be organized as a generic tool that can be reused in other projects.\nTo manage data at scale, NEAT will follow an architectural guideline that separates the overall system into two planes, namelythe Control Plane and Data Plane. The purpose of separating data from the controlling mechanism is to embrace the convention in the Cloud Native movement. Separating systems into composable modules made of meshed services. The origin of this idea of Control Plane vs. Data Plane was popularized by Istio\u0026rsquo;s Service Mesh architecture. However, this high level division of responsibilities is a useful guideline. The matching classification to NEAT and Newton\u0026rsquo;s namespace is shown as below.\n Continuous Workflow in evolving NEAT #  Implementing a programming language is about testing hypothesis of adopting various vocabulary in the expanding application contexts. Therefore it is a continuous learning process, and requires certain guidance in keeping pace of such wide open context of learning. A model to keep workflow in check is the well known Khun Cycle, similar to most Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CICD/CD) workflow. The term CI/CD is also very much tied to the notion of DevOps, as \u0026ldquo;Development\u0026rdquo; of new code base must be tightly integrated with the way data services are being \u0026ldquo;Operated\u0026rdquo;. The bluring of boundaries between model development and model operation is an inevitable trend as the cycle time of source code evolution is turing at a speed that can only be captured by having the entire development and deployment process run on a fully automated workflow. This fast-evolving idea of code evolution is compatible with the notion of Kuhn Cycle. The key concern in Kuhn Cycle is the idea of acquiring new vocabulary when the system reaches or identifies \u0026ldquo;immcommensurability\u0026rdquo; in its operating experience (problems detected through Data Plane). By applying CICD and being mindful of Kuhn\u0026rsquo;s vocabulary detecting/collecting Cycles, NEAT will become a living engine that is capable of learning and implementing new ideas. In other words, NEAT is designed as a community-based programming language, its own evolutionary cycles should follow a governance model that is similar to the experience of develping new versions of the NEAT language. In other words, NEAT aims to openly invite anyone to participate in the definition of a transaction processing language that is version controlled by a distributed timestamp system. Vocabulary has value, publically accepted vocabulary has measurable value. Ideally, the new NEAT types are new \u0026ldquo;models\u0026rdquo; learned from operational data, sometimes automatically learned through formal method tools or machine learning workflows. In the case of Newchain, since operational data are immutable data, capturing data content with \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; timestamps. These immutable and publicly revealed data can be the ideal grounding data for MLOps, as the Machine Learning enabled version of DevOps.\nControl Plane (Dev) #  Newton Community\u0026rsquo;s Infrastructure will carry the responsibility of offering the controlling mechanisms of non-repudiability and irrefutability trace. Newton Community demonstrate its service security through the liveness and safety of its \u0026ldquo;service mesh\u0026rdquo;, or the \u0026ldquo;Controlling Mechanism\u0026rdquo; of the operational data. Using this framework, a significant amount of existing code base can be leveraged for use immediately. In the Istio Architecture, the controlling mechanism for security is often called: \u0026ldquo;Citadel\u0026rdquo; component. Using existing code base that already has been tested by industrial strength solutions will drive the total amount of data to be processed through Newton Infrastructure.\nData Plane (Ops) #  The role of NEAT data type is to provide a typing classification scheme for ongoing implementation of specific asset types. Therefore, the focus of NEAT is to become a template, the unifying implementation to ensure the subsequent classes of application specific asset type could enjoy the same level of data security. From an practioner\u0026rsquo;s viewpoint, overtime, NEAT should have a significant number of application specific subtypes, such as the initally planned NEP-23: NEAT-Backed Currency and NEP-24: Newton Pre-paid Card . As the specific sub-types grow in number, more specific applications will have their own tailor-made data types. However, as the sub-type grow in number, the possible errors and potential redundancy will naturally dissipate attention and therefore increase the cost of source code quality maintenance. Therefore, the idea here is to design NEAT as the unifying data type for a programming language. A language specific dedicated to distributed transaction processing engine. Then, the vocabular adopted overtime, could be reused throughout the community, and even over the entire Internet. This way, we can encourage reuse of the high-level architecture. In other words, the Data Plane of NEAT is a dictionary for other implementation. We will design NEAT as a Domain Specific Language that can be customized and extended to other application specific languages. Then, the likelihood of having patterns in NEAT, such as NEAT-backed Currency (NBC) and NPC to be reused could be hidden in the implementation, so that the technical properties can be preserved. It is expected that implementers will add features within their own applications, and by managing the vocabulary as the Data Plane for a service system, we can alleviate some risks in being drawn to serve many design goals. Thereshould be only one unifying set of design goals in NEAT, that is to ensure system correctness, via safety and liveness concerns. Data security represent safety, and Performance features enables liveness possibilities.\nNamespace Management with Formal Methods and Industry Practices #  NEAT as a transaction protocol should define its namespace using Formal Methods and tools. For example, the critical terms, such as Transaction Initial Condition and Ending Conditiion, should be listed as reserved words using tools such as TLA+ to examine their tempoal logic possibilities. The namespace practice should not be only dependent on committee-based voting procedure, but it must include the analysis model of temporal dynamics, and then, use the analysis model as a collateral to support the decision for expanding or reducing the namespace of NEAT. NEAT should adapt open source software tools that has been extensively tested in known industrial applications. For example, for high throughput transactions, NEAT could adopt well-known messaging systems, such as Apache Kafka to implement Byzantine Fault Tolerance through a more flexible and higher bandwidth transaction engine. In certain cases, it is reasonable to identify third party solution providers to implement or offer high performance solutions that satisfies the abstraction functional specifications. For example, Axon Framework as a solution framework could be a starting point to address implementation issues. Regardless of which software framework to be adopted, NEAT will wrap an implementation-neutral Application Programming Interface (API) based on the abstract specifcation, so that NEAT will remain independent from specific implementation detail through API Namespace management. By orchestrating namespace in a unified fashion within NEAT specification, software developers and infrastructure operation providers can offer their services through the notions of FaaS (Function as a Service), Cloud Native Data Services, and Serverless applications, so that NEAT can be completely abstracted away from specific implementation and hardware maintenance.\nSecurity Considerations #  Every NEAT type should be a totally isolated container of its own risks. Every subtype of NEAT will define an equivalent class of risk as measured by our Control Plane. Therefore, the assets associated with the NEAT type should be defined as a bounded liability, so that its risk factors are isolated from the other parts of Newton infrastructure.\nThe Mechanisms of Proofs #  Every sub class of NEAT must go through a rigorous process to demonstrate that risks are divided into explicitly defined namespaces. The techical term is called identifying \u0026ldquo;Behavioral Equivalence\u0026rdquo;. Assets that can be exchanged through the same kind of transactional mechanisms, should use the same \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; of NEAT contract. The security features of each NEAT contract should be proven through the software development process. Certain anecdotal thinking can be found in Steiner\u0026rsquo;s blog entry 5. However, to reach a more rigorous level of security, NEAT should try to prove and approve every new subclass following formal methods as described in Rosu\u0026rsquo;s paper 6. Rosu also leads the K Framework development, which is a rewrite-based language design model that can be used to define and verify formal properties of any language. The argument that NEAT must be designed as a proto-language can be traced back to the legend of Tower of Babel, see  7. By having a sound and unifying linguistic root for all transactions, it will significantly broaden the application areas, and more importantly, reduce the risk the risks of misinterpretation, and increase the overall security of the entire transactional system. The working mechanism of proofs are managed in a namespace known as types of NEAT, so that all risk factors can be first reasoned in the categories, or types of risks, before committing to real world applications.\nWhat is a proof in NEAT? #  A proof in NEAT is to show that the contract will do what it claim to do under all possible circumstances.\nIf one only show that all past run time records have all satisfied the contract conditions, the data cannot complete a proof, because future events might break the system. Therefore proof can be done by going through certain automated abstractions. Automatic proof mechanisms have been made available for a while, certain commercial services (Inventor of K Framework, Rosu, created a start up to run mechanized proofs for blockchain contracts.) are also available to help verify \u0026ldquo;smart contract\u0026rdquo; on blockchain infrastructures. The point here is that NEAT should instill an internal mechanism to include certain assets to be allocated for writing and examing proofs. By including an overhead for proving integrity of NEAT contract will instill a new level of security in the design of NEAT system.\nThe dependency or logical sequences of proofs can be displayed as diagrams, also known as proof net. The process of submitting a new NEAT sub class is similar to the workflow of submitting a new piece of source code. The key contribution of Newton Technical Review Board is to provide a secure mechanism to insure irrefutability and provide quality control mechanisms that have been \u0026ldquo;proven\u0026rdquo; over time in the public domain. When uncertain conditions are met, the Newton Review Board will resort to explicit classification, and define a category of risk based on known data. By naming and classifying risks, it will provide significant reuse of intellectual labor to analyze the quality of proposed new NEAT subclasses, and therefore increase the quantity of transactions.\nBackwards Compatibility #  All NEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The NEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. NEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.\nTest Cases #  All test cases of NEAT should be classified into two kinds:\n Safety tests: examining conditions for when the contract execution will not cause undesirable situations. Liveness tests: examining conditions for when contract execution will ensure something desirable would actually happen.  The safety and liveness tests should be created based on tools such as Static Analysis and TLA+ and other similar test case generation tools.\nTest cases for NEAT should first be conducted on dedicated Newton Test Chain, so that the compatibility of the system could be managed between the two systems.\nReferences #  \n Leslie Lamport, Time, Clocks, and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System, Communications of the ACM, July, 1978.  \n Richard Stallman, Free Software, Free Society, Free Software Foundation, 2002, PDF  \nRobin Milner, The Polyadic Pi-Calculus a Tutorial, October, 1991  \nChris Newcombe, et al., How Amazon Web Services Uses Formal Methods, Communications of the ACM, April, 2015.  \n Jutta Steiner.

NPA requires certain proof mechanisms to be included as a part of guarantee to allow transaction of ownership. Two basic types of proof must be made available:\n Proof of Existence: The asset must provide some mechanism to show the asset exists, such as some online API to show that certain goods or services physically exist, that responded with some provable existence message. Proof of Ownership: This mechanism must provide certain information that shows the goods or services of interest can be traded under Newton accounts.  Besides the notion of Existence and Ownership, physical assets are further divided into two broad categories, often called: Movable/Personal and Immovable/Real Estate Properties. These asset terms are commonly used in legal and accounting practice, and will be adopted by NPA\u0026rsquo;s namespace management. However, under the accounting classification of Movable Properties, a special category called Intangible Property such as copyrights, brand names, or patents, are not considered a subclass of NPA. Intangible Property is to be classified as subclasses of Named Asset in the inheritance hierarchy of NEAT data types.\n Abstract #  Newton Physical Asset (NPA) is the base asset class that uses executable contract to guarantee the existence and ownership rights of physical assets. Knowing that the cybernetic world and the physical world could exist discrepancies, NPA attempts to approximate the existence and ownership proofs using a combination of four things: Proof of Stake, Soundness Analysis, Precision Analysis, and Time-bound Proofs. These four strategies of proving ownership and existence of physical goods provide a negotiation platform for all Newton account owners to engage with transactions. The design and evolution of NPA will follow the concepts originally developed in property law[1], where the basic rights associated with properties are broadly classified as: Rights to possession, use, manage, income generated, capital, and transmissibility. These rights applies to all assets, including non-physical assets. For NPA specific asset classes, Movable and Immovable assets are distinguished. Then, within Movable Assets, Consumable, Durable, and Interest Generating assets are classified. Within Immovable Assets, Owned and Leased Assets are the two main classes. These classifications are designed to offer time-based distinctions of relationships between assets and accounts.\nMotivation #  The key idea in NPA is to establish provable relationships between accounts and the physical piece of assets. NPA\u0026rsquo;s main design motivation is to leverage the cryptographically-protected account system with a trust-worthy timestamp data service and existing proof of stake insurance policies to secure NPA related transactions. In other words, the key idea of NPA is to unify the overarching framework rooted in NEAT. NPA helps to reduce costs of negotiation by introducing automated reasoning mechanisms about the claims of existence and ownership through Soundness Proofs, Precision Assessment[4], and Newton\u0026rsquo;s secure timestamp system.\nReuse Code by Sharing Expertise across the Supply Chain Management Industry #  Instead of requiring all NPA issuers to learn formal methods and speak in terms of Soundness, Precision, and time security. NPA will work with the standard vocabulary established in the supply chain industry, and primarily focus on proof mechanisms that are related to existence and ownership proofs. By translating the vocabulary from technical domains to supply chain domain, we can separate the work between the two professions. NPA issuers can search for existence and ownership proof in their business specific requirement language, and relevant soundness and precision reasoning mechanisms will be categorized in business terms to help NPA issuers to customize and compose existing executable code to support their needs. Once a new set of executable \u0026ldquo;smart\u0026rdquo; contract has been tested and proven to work in the marketplace with live data, the code can be shared to similar business practices across the Newton Community. Therefore, it is crucial to keep an abstract vocabulary to describe NPA, so that code reuse can be maximized.\nUser Interface for NPA #  When exchanging physical goods, buyers and sellers are likely to perform both sending and receiving roles interchangeably. A reason for the bi-directional sending and receiving functions on both buyer and seller sides is because physical goods might be returned or send back for repair or replacement. Therefore a set of user interfaces that define existence and ownership with precise time bounds on both ends become a significant driver in broadening user base.\nThe strategy for designing user interface of NPA is to insure that roles of sending and receiving are categorized into a set of functional specifications, so that the \u0026ldquo;skin\u0026rdquo; of the user interfaces can be attached to those standardized functional specifications interchangeably. By defining a set of generally applicable functional specifications for delivery and reception verification, NPA will be relatively easy to target many application contexts without having to reinvent the wheels everytime a new, but similar business model is created. This will also help Newton Community to reach a larger community base within a shorter amount of time.\nNon-repudiation Features #  Once certain physical goods are delivered or received, it is necessary to make sure that senders and receivers will not repudiate their reception or sending status. To minimize these possible information conflicts, repudiation resolution process should be designed as a measurable cost component, so that anyone who decides to go through a repudiation process, the system will automatically assign risk factors to parties who breached the repudiation contracts.\nNPA knowledge as a source of income #  Any vendors or buyers submitting bug reports or prescribe solutions to any of the above mentioned problems, will be automatically given credits or be rewarded of their contribution. The more of their cases being adopted and used as a resolution for future cases, the more credit they will receive. Buying and consuming as actions, will naturally accumulate operational data, and data can provide information and potential wisdom to better refine the overall framework of physical good exchange. An explicit reward mechanism will incentivize participants to actively contribute their intellect to help build up a better NPA transaction rule base.\nSpecification #  NPA should use NEAT as the basis of transaction model, which implicitly leverages secure timestamping services built-in Newton Infrastructure. Then, all physical goods must work with Newton Asset Namespace (NAM), so that a unifying namespace could be leveraged to reference known types of physical goods.\nThe existence and ownership status of physical items, should be bounded to existing industry standards or publicly verifiable data sources. Each of these existence and data precision qualities should be bounded to version controlled automatic analytical algorithms that defines the soundness and precision claims. Unless these self-administrating features are provided, no NPA should be issued.\nSyntax and Semantics #  The data structure and the meaning of transactional physical items should also be defined using ideas derived from pi-Calculus. This section inherits all features of NEAT, with the additional records that defines existence and ownership statuses.\n   Syntax Semantics     Account names: (Issuing Account)+ \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; (Receiving Accounts)+ The direction of asset right transfer: Issuing Accounts -\u0026gt; Receiver Accounts   Asset IDs : (Asset ID)_ \u0026ldquo;:\u0026rdquo; (Asset ID)_ The first set of (Asset ID)_ provides asset to be transferred to Receivers' (Asset ID)_   Time Slots: (Newchain timestamp)+ A sequence of timepoints of actual transactional events marked by (Newchain timestamp)+   Conditions: (Deliver Condition)+ \u0026lsquo;:\u0026rsquo; (Reception Condition)+ (Deliver Condition)+ \u0026lsquo;:\u0026rsquo; (Reception Condition)+ are two set of rules that defines the delivery and reception conditions of asset right transfer. Maybe associated with timestamp information shown in (3).   Comment Field: (Natural Language content that describes the contract) A field dedicate for human understanding, like the Ricardian Contract. The comments of NEAT can be written in a formatted template, the format could follow Logic Model.   Collateral Asset: (Asset ID)+ Collateral asset as a guarantee for participants of this transaction. This is usually defined by the insurance policy for the amount of resources to be issued to participants when transactions failed. (Asset ID)+ should be a set of transferrable assets that will be distributed in case the transaction fails. Initially, this can be certain amount of Newtons made available to insure the risk coverage of possible transaction failure modes.   Reimbursement Rules: (Rule for Reimbursement)+ A contract explicitly defines how to reimburse the participants when the transaction failed to work. The allocation of funds should be independent of the creator of this NEAT type. (Rule for Reimbursement)+: An automated executable contract, written in scripts that would allocate the available cryptographically ensured funds to participants according to various deliver/reception status. The creator of the executable contract should demonstrate that they are NOT in positions of conflict of interest.   Existence : (Rule for existence)+, (identity of physical item), (existence status) A list of rules stating how to judge the existence of certain name-identified physical item, in a set of defined existence status. (Assessment of Existence)+: A set of Soundness and Precision assessment algorithms defined in executable formats in Newton Infrastructure.   Ownership status: (Owner Account)+, (Rule for ownership status)+ A list of rules that defines the owners' identity, and a their ownership status of the above mentioned physical items in the existence field. (Assessment of Ownership)+: A set of Soundness and Precision assessment algorithms that can automatically check ownership status of the mentioned physical items in Newton Infrastructure.

The NEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

Every subtype of NEAT will define an equivalent class of risk as measured by our Control Plane. Therefore, the assets associated with the NEAT type should be defined as a bounded liability, so that its risk factors are isolated from the other parts of Newton infrastructure.\nThe Mechanisms of Proofs #  With modern Internet of Things (IoT) Infrastructure, many physical goods and services can attain multi-party, or independent sources of existence proof or ownership proof. Massively manufactured online sensors and actuators usually come with a Media Access Control Address (MAC address), these kind of information can provide the unique identities and locations of information validity. Couple with a distributed timestamp, which will be provided by Newchain, a time-bound security mechanism can be established to validate the proof. In NPA, we suggest the use of static analysis techniques, such as Abstract Interpretation [ 1] to perform Soundness and Precision Analysis. The notion of Soundness and Precision must be interpreted abstractly, meaning that the quality of NPA should be judged by how well the NPA presents \u0026ldquo; sound\u0026rdquo; judgement and \u0026ldquo;precise\u0026rdquo; approximation [ 2], as defined in static analysis tools, independent from the concrete execution of product transaction activities. All subclasses of NPA should follow the Soundness and Precision definition presented in this document, so that every NPA\u0026rsquo;s risk profile can be assessed based on these formally defined characteristics.\nEvery sub class of NEAT must go through a rigorous process to demonstrate that risks are divided into explicitly defined namespaces. The technical term is called identifying \u0026ldquo;Behavioral Equivalence\u0026rdquo;. Assets that can be exchanged through the same kind of transactional mechanisms, should use the same \u0026ldquo;class\u0026rdquo; of NEAT contract. The security features of each NEAT contract should be proven through the software development process. Certain anecdotal thinking can be found in Steiner\u0026rsquo;s blog entry[ 5].

The working mechanism of proofs are managed in a namespace known as types of NEAT, so that all risk factors can be first reasoned in the categories, or types of risks, before committing to real world applications.\nReferences #    Alison Clarke, Paul Kohler, Property Law: Commentary and Materials, Cambridge University Press, 2006\n   Alex Pentland, Alexander Lipton, and Thomas Hardjono, Building the New Economy, MIT Press\n   Patrick Cousot, Abstract Interpretation, Website\n  Bertrand Meyer, Soundness and Completeness: With Precision, Blog@CACM, April 20, 2019, Web, Web\n  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC BY-SA 4.0.\n"});index.add({'id':31,'href':'/neps/nep-24/','title':"Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC)",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #  Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC) is a cryptographically insured asset that works with exchangeable assets within the Newton Community. It can be extended to issue Membership Card, Score Cards, or even Balanced Score Cards. It can also possess negotiating powers in attaining tangible goods. For example, one may pre-pay for editable goods, such as vegetable, milk, or beef, or other kinds of commercially viable goods. The basic assumptions about NPC is that it provides a classification scheme to define goods. The two immediate categories are Membership Cards and Tangible Goods. These two classes are both sub-classes of Pre-Paid Card. The remaining subdivisions can be visualized in the following Class Diagram.\n Abstract #  Newtoin Pre-paid Card (NPC), is a divisible asset type that can be used to claim rights to group membership, or to claim ownership to tangible goods. The classification of rights should follow certain programmable contracts. NPC as an asset type is to serve as a template for many other classes of assets. Therefore, the development of NPC is not about operating a particular membership or selling tangible goods, it is about providing a general asset classification guideline to use a smaller common base classes to handle many cases of asset transaction for its sub-classes of goods and services. On the other hand, the purpose of NPC is to help Newton Community to best reuse data management technologies and mechanisms for asset transactions. For example, due to practical needs and regulatory concerns, there should be a certain difference in managing edible goods vs. non-edible goods. Therefore, there should be a publicized set of asset classes, encoded as two subclass branches. By explicitly managing the types of various contracts, Newton Infrastructure can better support the whole community to share knowledge in using Newton Community\u0026rsquo;s trust-worthy computing infrastructure. Initially, NPC assumes a single-inherentance class structure. Common interfaces between two non-directly inheritance branches can share APIs through the \u0026ldquo;interface\u0026rdquo; mechanism.\nThe collateral asset to guarantee values of NPC follows the original policies of NEAT. All Pre-paid Card should not only accept payment from buyers who want to own Newton Pre-paid Card, every NPC should come with an insurance policy that have a significant amount of collateral asset locked in a re-imbursement pool in case of contract breach conditions.\nMotivation #  The driving force behind NPC is to establish a standarized naming framework for managed assets. Currently, pre-paid good a services are mostly guaranteed by providers' brand recognition and customer\u0026rsquo;s willingness to risk their investment in exchange for advertised discounted prices. This human-trust mechanism basically leaves consumers to bare risks without any guarantee. Through the design of NPC, risks of different types of goods and services can be classified in our naming convention. Overtime, as real operational data reveals battle-ground situations for different types of goods and services, the contracts can evolve accordingly to capture the operational experience as learned data. It is crucial to emphasize that the Newton Technical Commitee is about designing a reusable framework to best support efficient business practices, it is not about operating actual services and good delivery. This position distinguishes the system design from profit making to community supporting. NPC wants as many types of membership groups, various kinds and large amounts of tangible goods to be bought and sold on the Newton Platform, so that all technical decisions for NPC must be vendor neutral.\nSpecification #  NPC is a subtype of NEAT, so that it will automatically inherit all the features of NEAT. The unique feature of NPC, is in its name, the notion of customer pre-payments. In other words, a significant amount of commercial risk is being shared by customers who pay ahead of time. To become eligible as an issuer of NPC, creator of NPC must demonstrate that they have the ability to deliver the announced services and goods. This process is almost identical to the process of \u0026ldquo;crowd funding\u0026rdquo;. Therefore, the qualification procedure that reveals the capabilities of potential capabilities of NPC issuer is the basis of NPC.\nFor service providers, such as club membership NPC issuer, history or proposed services must be articulated and presented as a part of the process to propose an NPC. Similarly, product providers should illustrate the types, qualities, and quantities of goods that certain vendor is capable of providing, so that they can offer to sell pre-paid cards. From NPC\u0026rsquo;s technical viewpoint, NPC\u0026rsquo;s nature is a publishing service for vendors to reveal their goods and services. The main security features of NPC is to show that all data concerning goods and services are irrefutably presented by the receiver of pre-paid assets. Establishing a content submission and account receivable channel, and make sure that both customers and vendors know that Newton only provides an irrefusable communication channel is the technical scope of NPC. In other words, NPC is not about designing a crowd funding website, NPC is about creating a irrefuable proof mechanism between vendors and potentially pre-paying customers. The focus of NPC is the security mechanism, not the product/service specific functionality.\nBeside focusing on security and irrepudiability, NPC also needs to provide guidelines to explain how to classified goods and services. Membership Cards often defines a given duration to service access, while Tangible Goods often defines rights to claim ownership. The technical focus of NPC is to show that each type of services and products might need a slightly different composition of verification API. For example, Membership Cards might need a time-based API, for verifying the validity of services. Where Tangible Goods might need an inventory checking API to see if certain goods are still available or not. These kinds of differences defines the types, so that NPC can give a common classification to different composition of status verification API. By offering a meaningful classification structure, more people can use NPC.\nSyntax and Semantics #  Here, pi-Calculus will play a major role in defining these interactions. For example, Membership Card would define a set of conditions, that illustrates the four basic components of:\n Choice of service package. Each given a name Parallel composition of service tracks Refusal or Prevention of certain services or event from occurence, (i.e. Non-Smoking) Replication of service Stopping of service.  By defininig a general set of service names, all Membership Cards can use the same vocabulary to define their service terms, so that Newton Infrastructure can be the technical provider of these service negotiation data, not the guarantor of these services.\nThe same syntax and semantics works for Tangible Goods. For example:\n Choice of products and amount defined by units and names of products Parallel composition of Product Delivery Refusal to certain products given certain composition. Replication of Products. Terminating product ownership status.  A set of programming interface will be defined for each of the two main subclasses, and all other services and products will follow this template to define other contracts.\nRationale #  NPC being a financial instrument, it must have some grounding rule to be acceptable by the broadest possible audience. The key idea is the notion of equality, to be explained in the term: Univalent Principle.\nUnivalent Foundation #   Univalent Foundation is a type-based mechanism to identify equivalence. Since data security and system integrity is achieved under a common transaction processing language NEAT, every NPC here is a type of transaction, and every instance of transaction should follow the same set of constraining rules. That gives a \u0026ldquo;equivalent\u0026rdquo; kind of fairness to all transaction. Having said that, it means all NPCs must strive to demonstrate certain objective fairness and security through its design. A starting point is to deposit certain amount of asset that reaches publicly agreements, then, all transactions can happen given that insurance asset is available to guarantee fairness. Other forms of fairness should be provided and tested prior to a release of any NPC. The reason being that any breached contract could cause significant social and economical damage to the system, therefore, a unifying safety procedure must be presented and followed for all systems.\nNPC\u0026rsquo;s unique functions #  NPC differs from other transactions in a sense that services and products are not directly controllable by the Newton Infrastructure. Therefore, the risks that incurred here must be somehow contained within the boundaries of the vendor that created their brand of NPC. The total amount of assets to be offered in exchange of pre-payments must have certain Univalent Principles to be automatically checked by the system. Otherwise, it would render the system to carry the risks for the NPC offering vendors, that is clearly not feasible.\nTherefore NPC must offer the following guarantee to its customers:\n Certain amount of deposit that ensures customer satisfaction. Minimal amount of deposit must fulfill conditions of Byzantine Fault Tolerance. Complete certain testing cycles before releasing to the public. Testing cycle will collect operational data, and this data must be revealed to its potential customers. NPC should have a screening procedure for its customers. Customers who is willing to participate must demonstrate certain level of data literacy before they are allowed to issue the initial down payment. Customers who enter the NPC agreements should agree to the reimbursement strategies prior to participation, so that potential conflicts can be minimized. All subtypes of NPC should strictly follow this agreement, otherwise, we will not be able to achieve Univalence, therefore breaching the system correctness assumptions as shown in NEAT.  Deployment Concerns #  The proper way of seeing NPC is to think of it as a class of financial future.

This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.\nWe considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more:\n Physical property — houses, unique artwork Virtual collectables — unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards “Negative value” assets — loans, burdens and other responsibilities  In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately.\nMotivation #  A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any NFT on Ethereum. We provide for simple NRC-7 smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of NFTs. Additional applications are discussed below.\nThis standard is inspired by the NRC-6 token standard and builds on two years of experience since NEP-6 was created. NEP-6 is insufficient for tracking NFTs because each asset is distinct (non-fungible) whereas each of a quantity of tokens is identical (fungible).\nDifferences between this standard and NEP-6 are examined below.\nSpecification #  The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\nEvery NRC-7 compliant contract must implement the NRC7 and ERC165 interfaces (subject to “caveats” below):\npragma solidity ^0.4.20; /// @title NRC-7 Non-Fungible Token Standard /// Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x80ac58cd. interface NRC7 /* is ERC165 */ { /// @dev This emits when ownership of any NFT changes by any mechanism.  /// This event emits when NFTs are created (`from` == 0) and destroyed  /// (`to` == 0).

A contract which complies with NRC-7 MUST also abide by the following:\n Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: payable, implicit nonpayable, view, and pure. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a payable function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayble (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract. Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements NRC7Metadata or NRC7Enumerable SHALL also implement NRC7. NRC-7 implements the requirements of interface ERC-165. Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as external then a contract will be compliant if it uses public visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to public before inheriting from your contract. Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of this.*.selector is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.  Rationale #  There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. Examples of existing or planned NFTs are LAND in Decentraland, the eponymous punks in CryptoPunks, and in-game items using systems like DMarket or EnjinCoin. Future uses include tracking real-world assets, like real-estate (as envisioned by companies like Ubitquity or Propy). It is critical in each of these cases that these items are not “lumped together” as numbers in a ledger, but instead each asset must have its ownership individually and atomically tracked. Regardless of the nature of these assets, the ecosystem will be stronger if we have a standardized interface that allows for cross-functional asset management and sales platforms.\n“NFT” Word Choice #  “NFT” was satisfactory to nearly everyone surveyed and is widely applicable to a broad universe of distinguishable digital assets. We recognize that “deed” is very descriptive for certain applications of this standard (notably, physical property).\nAlternatives considered: distinguishable asset, title, token, asset, equity, ticket\nNFT Identifiers #  Every NFT is identified by a unique uint256 ID inside the NRC-7 smart contract. This identifying number SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The pair (contract address, uint256 tokenId) will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. While some NRC-7 smart contracts may find it convenient to start with ID 0 and simply increment by one for each new NFT, callers SHALL NOT assume that ID numbers have any specific pattern to them, and MUST treat the ID as a “black box”. Also note that a NFTs MAY become invalid (be destroyed). Please see the enumerations functions for a supported enumeration interface.\nThe choice of uint256 allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to uint256.\nTransfer Mechanism #  NRC-7 standardizes a safe transfer function safeTransferFrom (overloaded with and without a bytes parameter) and an unsafe function transferFrom. Transfers may be initiated by:\n The owner of an NFT The approved address of an NFT An authorized operator of the current owner of an NFT  Additionally, an authorized operator may set the approved address for an NFT. This provides a powerful set of tools for wallet, broker and auction applications to quickly use a large number of NFTs.\nThe transfer and accept functions’ documentation only specify conditions when the transaction MUST throw. Your implementation MAY also throw in other situations. This allows implementations to achieve interesting results:\n Disallow transfers if the contract is paused — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, line 611 Blacklist certain address from receiving NFTs — prior art, CryptoKitties deployed contract, lines 565, 566 Disallow unsafe transfers — transferFrom throws unless _to equals msg.sender or countOf(_to) is non-zero or was non-zero previously (because such cases are safe) Charge a fee to both parties of a transaction — require payment when calling approve with a non-zero _approved if it was previously the zero address, refund payment if calling approve with the zero address if it was previously a non-zero address, require payment when calling any transfer function, require transfer parameter _to to equal msg.sender, require transfer parameter _to to be the approved address for the NFT Read only NFT registry — always throw from unsafeTransfer, transferFrom, approve and setApprovalForAll  Failed transactions will throw, a best practice identified in ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-827 and OpenZeppelin’s implementation of SafeERC20.sol. ERC-20 defined an allowance feature, this caused a problem when called and then later modified to a different amount, as on OpenZeppelin issue #438. In NRC-7, there is no allowance because every NFT is unique, the quantity is none or one. Therefore we receive the benefits of ERC-20’s original design without problems that have been later discovered.\nCreating of NFTs (“minting”) and destruction NFTs (“burning”) is not included in the specification. Your contract may implement these by other means. Please see the event documentation for your responsibilities when creating or destroying NFTs.\nWe questioned if the operator parameter on onERC721Received was necessary. In all cases we could imagine, if the operator was important then that operator could transfer the token to themself and then send it – then they would be the from address. This seems contrived because we consider the operator to be a temporary owner of the token (and transferring to themself is redundant). When the operator sends the token, it is the operator acting on their own accord, NOT the operator acting on behalf of the token holder. This is why the operator and the previous token owner are both significant to the token recipient.\nAlternatives considered: only allow two-step NERC-6 style transaction, require that transfer functions never throw, require all functions to return a boolean indicating the success of the operation.\nERC-165 Interface #  We chose Standard Interface Detection (ERC-165) to expose the interfaces that a NRC-7 smart contract supports.\nA future EIP may create a global registry of interfaces for contracts. We strongly support such an EIP and it would allow your NRC-7 implementation to implement NRC7Enumerable, NRC7Metadata, or other interfaces by delegating to a separate contract.\nTest Cases #  TBD\nImplementations #  TBD\nReferences #   ERC-721 Non-fungible Token Standard. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721 ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection. https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165 NRC6 Token Standard. https://github.com/newtonproject/NEPs/edit/main/NEPS/nep-6/index.md  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n"});index.add({'id':34,'href':'/neps/nep-47/','title':"Parameter Updates on Community Node and vote",'section':"NEPs",'content':"Simple Summary #  This proposal contains parameter changes on community node mining, including NEW staking period, mining reward calculation, and minumam lock amount.\nAbstract #  Changes on NewPay:\n Change NEW staking period on community node and vote. Change minumam lock amount on community node and vote to 10000 NEW. Change community node NF factor to 1, same as community vote NF factor.  Motivation #  NewChain MainNet ledger nodes are open to public since NEP-27 has been implemented. According to NEP-40, Newton community has more posibilities to participate in Newon ecosystem and get rewards. NEP-45 provides an incentive plan for ledger nodes to make sure the Newton network is more open and stable.\nNEP-27, NEP-40, and NEP-45 has been implemented. This proposal is made in order to make Newton network more open and more equitable, to motivate Newton community to participate in the ledger nodes bookkeeping, liquidity mining, which are mentioned in NEP-40, and to increase the liquidity of NEW.\nThe proposal is designed to reduce the complexity of the management of community nodes in the Newpay App, and enable all community members to join in the Newton Incentive Plan freely. Therefore, community participants are encouraged to use their NEW to participate in all Newton Incentive Programs, including but not limited to Newpay Community Node Mining, ledger Node Mining, and liquidity mining.\nSpecification #  Changes on staking rules of community node and community vote #  Community node vote could add or reduce staking at any time, specifically the following below:\n Allow community node owners (including partner node owners) create or quit a node at any time, add or reduce staking at any time.

Allow community node voters vote or quit a node at any time, add or reduce staking at any time.  The following rules remain same:\n Added/reduced staking NEW is effective after 24 hours, which means the changed part of NEW will not be counted in NewForce reward.  Changes on NEW unlock periods of community node and community vote #   Community node owners (including partner node owners) unlock period changes from 7 days to 0 day, which means unlocked NEW will be returned immediately.

The traditional production, supply and marketing system, which focuses on logistics and capital flow, is upgraded to the supply chain credit system, which solves the credit construction problem of physical Commodity in the process of production and circulation, and realizes the traceability and tracking of goods.\nFrom manufacturing to circulation, the essence of commodities is the process of continuous interaction and confirmation among raw material suppliers, manufacturers, channel agents, distributors and consumers of information flow, capital flow and logistics, and the core of which is the supply chain system. Efficient lubrication of the supply chain system will greatly reduce the time cost and capital cost of enterprises, and improve the production efficiency of enterprises. To achieve such an efficient and lubricated supply chain system, the key is to establish a supply chain credit system, which is the key to improve production efficiency and capital efficiency, and reduce production, logistics and storage costs. The traditional solution mainly depends on the contract signed by all parties, so the contract becomes the core element for the related parties to confirm the ownership and income. The tamperable blockchain technology makes it possible to create a new paradigm of credit system under the condition of new technology. A complete blockchain credit system includes not only the individual credit of each industrial subject (such as legal registration, compliance operation, quality certification system, bank credit, etc.), but also the business reputation established by upstream and downstream manufacturers in the supply chain in the actual business cooperation, which can be fully reflected in the blockchain and cannot be tampered with.\nMotivation #  There are mainly two stages in the process of commodity from scratch to consumers' purchase.\nThe first stage is the production stage, mainly from raw materials to production, to channel agents or distributors. The main problem in this stage is the supply chain, and the core body is the producer. Specifically, it includes the long period of signing the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s contract (purchase of raw materials and sales to channel agents or distributors), the uncertainty of the time when raw materials are transported to the factory, the high cost of raw materials storage, and the large capital pressure.\nThe second stage is the circulation stage, and the core body is channel agents or distributors, who directly face individual consumers. Their main problems are that they occupy a large amount of capital, have a weak control over capital efficiency and liquidity, and have a high storage cost.\nIn addition, for consumers, it is difficult to have objective and real data to prove the source, quality and value of the purchased Commodity. It is necessary to collect necessary data through the whole traceability system of the Internet of things, and confirm it through the tamperability of the blockchain.\nA credible commodity needs not only reliable raw material supply, but also reliable manufacturers and sellers. In this way, it can not only ensure the high credibility of commodities, but also ensure the credibility of circulation links.\nEach manufacturer or business in the industrial chain is responsible for its own product quality, forming a product credit island. A complete blockchain credit system running through raw material suppliers, producers, channel agents (distributors) and consumers can fundamentally solve the problems concerned by all parties in the industrial chain. Any entity in the industrial chain can confirm its upstream and downstream manufacturers or merchants in the blockchain, realize interactive verification, and then form the blockchain credit system.\nSpecification #  The most important document in the transaction of physical commodity is the purchase contract between the buyer and the seller. The contract will specify the quantity, specification, model, unit price, total price, payment method and other important information of this transaction.\nThe establishment of physical commodity supply chain credit system mainly includes the following attributes.\n  Physical properties ofcommodity: brand, product name, specification and model, production date, warranty period, precautions, etc., especially the relevant data collected through the Internet of things are more authoritative and credible.\n  Manufacturers and merchants: brand, trademark, qualification, process standard, etc.\n  Certification certificate of the third party organization: such as quality management system, safety management system, inspection and test report.\n  Government competent / regulatory authorities: such as industrial and commercial registration documents, tax documents, customs documents, etc\n  According to the role of commodity production and circulation, the subject attribute is defined, and the product or commodity attribute is defined according to the subject.\n  Raw material supplier: sign raw material supply and marketing contract according to the manufacturer\u0026rsquo;s demand order, and provide raw materials with quality and quantity as agreed in the contract. Its main attributes include: Industrial and commercial registration documents, qualification documents, qualification documents, inspection and testing reports, quality assurance system, production standards, management system and main processes. Its raw material properties include: Specification and model, quality inspection report, main technical indicators, precautions, etc. In terms of agricultural products, tea, flowers, fruits and vegetables, the raw material supplier also refers to the main body of breeding, and its main attributes also include the weather data related to temperature, humidity, precipitation, fertilization and irrigation during the breeding process. The data form includes video, which can be real-time or non real-time.\n  Product manufacturer: according to the production plan, sign the raw material supply and marketing contract with the raw material supplier, and pay the corresponding amount to the raw material supplier. According to the needs of channel agents or distributors, sign sales contracts with them, collect payment for commodity and provide goods. Its main attributes include: Industrial and commercial registration documents, qualification documents, qualification documents, inspection and testing reports, quality assurance system, production standards, management system and main processes. Its commodity attributes include: Specification and model, quality inspection report, main technical indicators, precautions, etc.\n  Channel agent or distributor: sign supply and marketing contract with commodity manufacturer, pay for commodity, and promote sales to consumers. Collect payment from consumers and provide them with commodity and services. Its main attributes include: Industrial and commercial registration documents, qualification documents, qualification documents, inspection and testing reports. Its commodity attributes include: Specification and model, quality inspection report, main technical indicators, precautions, etc.; its operation attributes include information of goods on and off the shelf, marketing activities, discounts, points, etc.\n  Logistics service provider: an enterprise that provides logistics services in raw materials, commodities, retail and other links. Its main attributes include: Industrial and commercial registration documents, qualification documents and qualification documents. Its service attributes include data information in the logistics process, such as cargo location information, expected delivery information, transporter information, and, if necessary, temperature, humidity and other information in the vehicle body.\n  Consumers: place orders with dealers, pay for goods and purchase commodity. In addition to personal information, it also includes return and exchange information, payment and refund information, receiving information, complaints, etc.\n  In the process of commodity production and circulation, the core users are producers and channel agents / distributors. With the extension of the supply chain, the ownership of raw materials and commodities will also be transferred with the execution of corresponding contracts. That is to say, a complete and reliable commodity blockchain, in addition to the main physical properties of this commodity, should include the blockchain of raw materials or products of its upstream major suppliers.\nMeta Data #     Item Description Behaviors/Properties     Owner Create Commodity Token    Commodity Commodity Info.：TokenId、Contracts、URL、Partners token: raw material suppliers, manufacturers, channel agents, distributors。     Interaction / Functions #     Function Description Behaviors/Properties     Mint Create Commodity Token permission：Owner   Transfer transfer own to Partners NEW Address permission: Neworg   Get Extension String get extension string data    Set Extension String set extension string data permission: Owner    Rationale (optional) #  The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.\nBackwards Compatibility (optional) #  All NEPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The NEP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. NEP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.\nTest Cases (optional) #  Take the production and sales of new energy vehicles as an example. New energy vehicle manufacturers will have several core suppliers, such as automobile chassis, motor, battery pack and battery management system, automobile glass, etc. The blockchain of new energy vehicles will include its supplier contract, the blockchain of supplier products (automobile chassis, motor, battery pack and battery management system, automobile glass, etc.). The blockchain of new energy vehicles will also be delivered to auto agents or dealers, and finally to consumers.\nImplementation (optional) #  The implementations must be completed before any NEP is given status \u0026ldquo;Final\u0026rdquo;, but it need not be completed before the NEP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of \u0026ldquo;rough consensus and running code\u0026rdquo; is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.\nSecurity Considerations #  References #  Copyright #  Copyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n"});})();
