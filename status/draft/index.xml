Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.
Motivation # A standard interface allows any tokens on NewChain to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Change On Community NEW Release Plan</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-40/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-40/</guid><description>Simple Summary # To advance the NewChain development, the original NEW release plan of the community (60% of 100B total supply) will be changed as described below.
Abstract # The total supply of NEW is 100B, 60% of which is subjected to the community.
It can be divided into three parts as below:
already released: 1545232707.3505096555 NEW 2021/2/1-2022/1/31 for incentives: 875130267.8946381786 NEW the rest: 57579637024.7548521659 NEW (will be decided by the future community governance) The seconds part will be used for supporting the Newton Incentive Program.</description></item><item><title>Invoice Token Standard (NRC-10)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-10/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for invoice token.
Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for invoice token within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to issue、reimburse and invalidate invoice token.
Motivation # A standard interface allows tax/invoice/financial applications to work with invoice token on NewChain. We provide for simple invoiceToken smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of invoice tokens.</description></item><item><title>NEAT Backed Currency (NBC)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-23/</guid><description>Simple Summary # NEAT Backed Currency (NBC) is a kind of cryptographically secured currency following the design protocol of NEAT. The goal of this creation is the allow anyone to create a set of exchangeable, and divisible asset that can be securely exchanged using the platform provided by Newton Community. We used the term community, because the distributed security, must be backed by a community of infrastructure providers and a rather healthy exchange community.</description></item><item><title>NewChain MainNet Opening</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-27/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-27/</guid><description>Simple Summary # After NewChain TestNet successful opening, NewChain MainNet is going to be opened by inviting the community to setup, run and maintain the ledger nodes.
Abstract # In current stage, NewChain MainNet would still run with PoA (Proof-of-Authority) consensus mechanism for producing blocks. Hence a certain amount of staking would be required for keeping the ledger nodes honest and not be malicious to harm the network.</description></item><item><title>NewORG Standard (NRC-12)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-12/</guid><description>Simple Summary # NewOrg template standard represents the living organization in newton ecosystem and a new DAO paradigm for the next generation social governance and collaboration.
Abstract # NewOrg methods and standard based on NewChain and smart contract technologies are defined as is:
based on NewChain and its smart contract technologies. to replace the traditional limited corporation with new governance paradigm based on blockchain technologies. to define a set of meta rules for organization governance, and clarify the separation of these rules between NewChain layer and contract layer to implement: (1) business irrelative meta rules; (2) flexibility of neworg governance token; (3) anchoring all neworg to NewChain.</description></item><item><title>NewPay Community Node Migration</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-29/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-29/</guid><description>Simple Summary # As part of the NewChain MainNet opening strategy and upgrading plan, the current &amp;ldquo;community nodes&amp;rdquo; in NewPay for virtual mining would be migrated and resolved for paving the way of NewChain to embrace a more bright future.
This proposal will illustrate a possible solution for migrating them to be integrated into the NewSwap mining framework to also benefit the development of NewSwap.
Abstract # The current &amp;ldquo;community nodes&amp;rdquo; in NewPay are doing &amp;ldquo;virtual mining&amp;rdquo; nowadays for daily released NEW from NewPool.</description></item><item><title>Newton Composite Asset (NCA)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-22/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Composite Asset (NCA) is the base pattern of asset combination that defines the boundary of how two or more than two assets are combined as a single instance. NCA distinguishes from the other types of asset by involving more than one NEAT. Every NCA is defined based on the principle of Behavioral Equivalence 1, so that unique properties of NCA can be distinguished computationally and therefore maximize the possibility of code reuse and automated asset valuation.</description></item><item><title>Newton Encoded Asset Transaction (NEAT)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-20/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Encoded Asset Transaction(NEAT) defines the root data type for all asset exchanges. Once a new record of NEAT is registered into Newchain, it represents a form of irrefutable accountability based on the immutable features of Newchain. To help transaction assess the worthiness of transactions before their commitment, all transactions have a common field, called: Bounded Accountability, which defines all known exit conditions when a transactional process is breached.</description></item><item><title>Newton Physical Asset (NPA)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-21/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Physical Asset (NPA) is the base class of physical asset classes. NPA requires certain proof mechanisms to be included as a part of guarantee to allow transaction of ownership. Two basic types of proof must be made available:
Proof of Existence: The asset must provide some mechanism to show the asset exists, such as some online API to show that certain goods or services physically exist, that responded with some provable existence message.</description></item><item><title>Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-24/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC) is a cryptographically insured asset that works with exchangeable assets within the Newton Community. It can be extended to issue Membership Card, Score Cards, or even Balanced Score Cards. It can also possess negotiating powers in attaining tangible goods. For example, one may pre-pay for editable goods, such as vegetable, milk, or beef, or other kinds of commercially viable goods. The basic assumptions about NPC is that it provides a classification scheme to define goods.</description></item><item><title>Non-Fungible Token Standard (NRC-7)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-7/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.
Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.
We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets.</description></item><item><title>Physical Commodity Standard (NRC-19)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-19/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for Physical Commodity token
Abstract # This template mainly uses the block chain encryption and non tampering features to verify the ownership, capital flow, receipt confirmation and other information of the physical Commodity involved in the production and circulation process, and synthesizes the information flow, capital flow and logistics flowing in the whole process of raw material suppliers, producers, channel agents, dealers and consumers through the block chain technology There is a sound system of credit value flow.</description></item></channel></rss>
