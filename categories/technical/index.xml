Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.
Motivation # A standard interface allows any tokens on NewChain to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.</description></item><item><title>Boom: EVM and Protocol Upgrades</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-26/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-26/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Enable the outstanding Ethereum Foundation Constantinople, St. Petersburg and Istanbul network protocol upgrades on the NewChain network in a hard-fork code-named Boom to enable maximum compatibility across these networks.
Abstract # Add support for a subset of protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Foundation (ETH) network via the Constantinople, St. Petersburg and Istanbul hardforks. The proposed changes for NewChain&amp;rsquo;s Boom upgrade include:
Bitwise shifting instructions in EVM Skinny CREATE2 EXTCODEHASH opcode Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps Add Blake2 compression function F precompile Reduce alt_bn128 precompile gas costs Add ChainID opcode Repricing for trie-size-dependent opcodes Calldata gas cost reduction Rebalance net-metered SSTORE gas cost with consideration of SLOAD gas cost change This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the NewChain networks:</description></item><item><title>Encrypted Variable Token Proposal (NRC-53)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-53/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-53/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for encrypted variable tokens.
Abstract # EVT(Encrypted Variable Token) is the replacement of NFT in metaverse and physical world.
The key features of EVT are variableness, encryption, traceability.
The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for EVTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track, transfer, dynamic properties, encryption.
We considered the use cases of EVTs including vitality assets, privacy based assets, digital identities.</description></item><item><title>Fee market change for NewChain</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-52/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-52/</guid><description>Simple Summary # This proposal proposes a transaction pricing mechanism, based on Ether EIP-1559, for NewChain that forces to burn a minimum amount per block, while exempting the consensus layer transactions from network fee.
Abstract # As described in EIP-1559, we introduce a new EIP-2718 transaction type, with the format 0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s]).
There is a base fee per gas in protocol, which can move up or down each block according to a formula which is a function of gas used in parent block and gas target (block gas limit divided by elasticity multiplier) of parent block.</description></item><item><title>Invoice Token Standard (NRC-10)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-10/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-10/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for invoice token.
Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for invoice token within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to issue、reimburse and invalidate invoice token.
Motivation # A standard interface allows tax/invoice/financial applications to work with invoice token on NewChain. We provide for simple invoiceToken smart contracts as well as contracts that track an arbitrarily large number of invoice tokens.</description></item><item><title>Multi Token Standard (NRC-50)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-50/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-50/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for contracts that manage multiple token types. A single deployed contract may include any combination of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens or other configurations (e.g. semi-fungible tokens).
Abstract # This standard outlines a smart contract interface that can represent any number of fungible and non-fungible token types. Existing standards such as NRC-6 require deployment of separate contracts per token type. The NRC-7 standard’s token ID is a single non-fungible index and the group of these non-fungibles is deployed as a single contract with settings for the entire collection.</description></item><item><title>NEAT Backed Currency (NBC)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-23/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-23/</guid><description>Simple Summary # NEAT Backed Currency (NBC) is a kind of cryptographically secured currency following the design protocol of NEAT. The goal of this creation is the allow anyone to create a set of exchangeable, and divisible asset that can be securely exchanged using the platform provided by Newton Community. We used the term community, because the distributed security, must be backed by a community of infrastructure providers and a rather healthy exchange community.</description></item><item><title>NewORG Standard (NRC-12)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-12/</guid><description>Simple Summary # NewOrg template standard represents the living organization in newton ecosystem and a new DAO paradigm for the next generation social governance and collaboration.
Abstract # NewOrg methods and standard based on NewChain and smart contract technologies are defined as is:
based on NewChain and its smart contract technologies. to replace the traditional limited corporation with new governance paradigm based on blockchain technologies. to define a set of meta rules for organization governance, and clarify the separation of these rules between NewChain layer and contract layer to implement: (1) business irrelative meta rules; (2) flexibility of neworg governance token; (3) anchoring all neworg to NewChain.</description></item><item><title>Newton Composite Asset (NCA)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-22/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Composite Asset (NCA) is the base pattern of asset combination that defines the boundary of how two or more than two assets are combined as a single instance. NCA distinguishes from the other types of asset by involving more than one NEAT. Every NCA is defined based on the principle of Behavioral Equivalence 1, so that unique properties of NCA can be distinguished computationally and therefore maximize the possibility of code reuse and automated asset valuation.</description></item><item><title>Newton Encoded Asset Transaction (NEAT)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-20/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-20/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Encoded Asset Transaction(NEAT) defines the root data type for all asset exchanges. Once a new record of NEAT is registered into Newchain, it represents a form of irrefutable accountability based on the immutable features of Newchain. To help transaction assess the worthiness of transactions before their commitment, all transactions have a common field, called: Bounded Accountability, which defines all known exit conditions when a transactional process is breached.</description></item><item><title>Newton Physical Asset (NPA)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-21/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-21/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Physical Asset (NPA) is the base class of physical asset classes. NPA requires certain proof mechanisms to be included as a part of guarantee to allow transaction of ownership. Two basic types of proof must be made available:
Proof of Existence: The asset must provide some mechanism to show the asset exists, such as some online API to show that certain goods or services physically exist, that responded with some provable existence message.</description></item><item><title>Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-24/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-24/</guid><description>Simple Summary # Newton Pre-paid Card (NPC) is a cryptographically insured asset that works with exchangeable assets within the Newton Community. It can be extended to issue Membership Card, Score Cards, or even Balanced Score Cards. It can also possess negotiating powers in attaining tangible goods. For example, one may pre-pay for editable goods, such as vegetable, milk, or beef, or other kinds of commercially viable goods. The basic assumptions about NPC is that it provides a classification scheme to define goods.</description></item><item><title>Non-Fungible Token Standard (NRC-7)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-7/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-7/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds.
Abstract # The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs.
We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (“operators”). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets.</description></item><item><title>Physical Commodity Standard (NRC-19)</title><link>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://neps.newtonproject.org/neps/nep-19/</guid><description>Simple Summary # A standard interface for Physical Commodity token
