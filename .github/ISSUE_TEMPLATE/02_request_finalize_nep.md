**Describe your request here**

I and other authors believe NEP-N is ready to be finalised.

Once the request has been approved, the status of the NEP will be changed from `Draft` to `Public Call` requesting public to review. A `review-period-end` date will be added to that NEP, normally for 14 days. If there are no issues of the that NEP to be finalised from public. The NEP status will be changed to `Final` or `Active` depending the type of that NEP. If that NEP did not pass the review. The status will be changed back to `Draft`, and this issue will be closed.

Once the NEP status has changed to `Final`, it can't be updated for changes anymore. Only minor adjusts can be made later, such as typing errors etc.
